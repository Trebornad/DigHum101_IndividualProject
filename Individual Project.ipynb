    "### Analyzing the Frankenstein word-count\n",
    "\n",
    "   So, is counting words enough for understanding Frankenstein if I am already aware of the text? Or do we need to implement other digital techniques like topic modeling and neural networks to actually gain something from it? The answer to this question, I think, depends on how you approach literary analysis. \n",
    "    On the one hand, these words may not be too significant. The number one \"word\" is actually just a set of quotation marks - which is probably due to some faulty code on my end - so I will move to the second word: \"one\". In the context of the story, \"one\" can have different meanings; it can refer to a number or be a neutral pronoun used for an individual (for example, \"one must eat to survive.\"). \"One,\" I think, evokes a sense of solitude and I think sumplements the lonliness in the story itself, both on the part of Dr. Frankenstein, the scientist who attempts to create his own being, and his creation, who is abandoned by his creator and is unable to find love or affection. \n",
    "    It is interesting that in a story based around scientific endeavor, upon amazing \"progress,\" the only word that gets at that progress for me is \"great,\" which sits in the top right corner of the word cloud. Instead, words like \"man,\" \"friend,\" \"feel,\" \"see\", \"yet\" appear more frequently. The story of Frankenstein is not about greatness, not about the inhuman, but about humanity itself: about friends, feeling, experiencing, wishing. \n",
    "    Before moving onto the next story I will be counting, I do want to come back to the quotation marks. Although initially a mistake, I kept them because they do point to the fact that most of the story is in dialogue; it is not a series of live events but is instead told to us through letters, through memory, through conversation. \n",
    "    I do think that word counts can supplement the process of literary analysis. It is especially cool to see the most common words in the story with knowledge of the story itself, because it does in fact make sense that these words are most common. This word cloud offers a creative new way to approach Frankenstein.\n",

      "going to be credit-happy--if it works out--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, perversely, Dane held to a gloomier view of the immediate future.\r\n",
      "\"_If_,\" he repeated. \"There's a galaxy of 'ifs' in this Sargol\r\n",
      "proposition. All very well for you to rest easy on your fins--you don't\r\n",

      "on its ruby tinted soil this morning no lingering taint of his off-world\r\n",
      "origin must remain to disgust the sensitive nostrils of the Salariki. He\r\n",
      "supposed he would get used to this process. After all this was the first\r\n",
      "time he had undergone the ritual. But he couldn't lose the secret\r\n",
      "conviction that it was all very silly. Only what Rip had pointed out was\r\n",
      "the truth--one adjusted to the customs of aliens or one didn't trade and\r\n",
      "there were other things he might have had to do on other worlds which\r\n",

      "there he lingered, waiting for Van Rycke, the Cargo-master of the spacer\r\n",
      "and his immediate superior. It was early morning and now that he was out\r\n",
      "of the confinement of the ship the fresh morning winds cut about him,\r\n",
      "rippling through the blue-green grass forest beyond, to take much of his\r\n",
      "momentary irritation with them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were no mountains in this section of Sargol--the highest elevations\r\n",
      "being rounded hills tightly clothed with the same ten-foot grass which\r\n",
      "covered the plains. From the Queen's observation ports, one could watch\r\n",
      "the constant ripple of the grass so that the planet appeared to be\r\n",
      "largely clothed in a shimmering, flowing carpet. To the west were the\r\n",
      "seas--stretches of shallow water so cut up by strings of islands that\r\n",
      "they more resembled a series of salty lakes. And it was what was to be\r\n",
      "found in those seas which had lured the Solar Queen to Sargol.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though, by rights, the discovery was that of another Trader--Traxt\r\n",
      "Cam--who had bid for trading rights to Sargol, hoping to make a\r\n",
      "comfortable fortune--or at least expenses with a slight profit--in the\r\n",
      "perfume trade, exporting from the scented planet some of its most\r\n",
      "fragrant products. But once on Sargol he had discovered the Koros\r\n",
      "stones--gems of a new type--a handful of which offered across the board\r\n",
      "in one of the inner planet trading marts had nearly caused a riot among\r\n",
      "bidding gem merchants. And Cam had been well on the way to becoming one\r\n",
      "of the princes of Trade when he had been drawn into the vicious net of\r\n",
      "the Limbian pirates and finished off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Because they, too, had stumbled into the trap which was Limbo, and had\r\n",
      "had a very definite part in breaking up that devilish installation, the\r\n",
      "crew of the Solar Queen had claimed as their reward the trading rights of\r\n",
      "Traxt Cam in default of legal heirs. And so here they were on Sargol with\r\n",
      "the notes left by Cam as their guide, and as much lore concerning the\r\n",
      "Salariki as was known crammed into their minds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane sat down on the end of the ramp, his feet on Sargolian soil, thin,\r\n",
      "red soil with glittering bits of gold flake in it. He did not doubt that\r\n",
      "he was under observation from hidden eyes, but he tried to show no sign\r\n",
      "that he guessed it. The adult Salariki maintained at all times an\r\n",
      "attitude of aloof and complete indifference toward the Traders, but the\r\n",
      "juvenile population were as curious as their elders were contemptuous.\r\n",
      "Perhaps there was a method of approach in that. Dane considered the idea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Van Rycke and Captain Jellico had handled the first negotiations--and the\r\n",
      "process had taken most of a day--the result totaling exactly nothing. In\r\n",
      "their contacts with the off world men the feline ancestered Salariki were\r\n",
      "ceremonious, wary, and completely detached. But Cam had gotten to them\r\n",
      "somehow--or he would not have returned from his first trip with that\r\n",
      "pouch of Koros stones. Only, among his records, salvaged on Limbo, he had\r\n",
      "left absolutely no clue as to how he had beaten down native sales\r\n",
      "resistance. It was baffling. But patience had to be the middle name of\r\n",
      "every Trader and Dane had complete faith in Van. Sooner or later the\r\n",
      "Cargo-master would find a key to unlock the Salariki.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As if the thought of Dane's chief had summoned him, Van Rycke, his\r\n",
      "scented tunic sealed to his bull's neck in unaccustomed trimness, his\r\n",
      "cap on his blond head, strode down the ramp, broadcasting waves of\r\n",
      "fragrance as he moved. He sniffed vigorously as he approached his\r\n",
      "assistant and then nodded in approval.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So you're all greased and ready--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is the Captain coming too, sir?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Van Rycke shook his head. \"This is our headache. Patience, my boy,\r\n",
      "patience--\" He led the way through a thin screen of the grass on the\r\n",
      "other side of the scorched landing field to a well-packed earth road.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again Dane felt eyes, knew that they were being watched. But no Salarik\r\n",
      "stepped out of concealment. At least they had nothing to fear in the way\r\n",
      "of attack. Traders were immune, taboo, and the trading stations were set\r\n",
      "up under the white diamond shield of peace, a peace guaranteed on blood\r\n",
      "oath by every clan chieftain in the district. Even in the midst of\r\n",
      "interclan feuding deadly enemies met in amity under that shield and would\r\n",
      "not turn claw knife against each other within a two mile radius of its\r\n",
      "protection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The grass forests rustled betrayingly, but the Terrans displayed no\r\n",
      "interest in those who spied upon them. An insect with wings of brilliant\r\n",
      "green gauze detached itself from the stalk of a grass tree and fluttered\r\n",
      "ahead of the Traders as if it were an official herald. From the red soil\r\n",
      "crushed by their boots arose a pungent odor which fought with the scent\r\n",
      "they carried with them. Dane swallowed three or four times and hoped that\r\n",
      "his superior officer had not noticed that sign of discomfort. Though Van\r\n",
      "Rycke, in spite of his general air of sleepy benevolence and careless\r\n",
      "goodwill, noticed everything, no matter how trivial, which might have a\r\n",
      "bearing on the delicate negotiations of Galactic Trade. He had not\r\n",
      "climbed to his present status of expert Cargo-master by overlooking\r\n",
      "anything at all. Now he gave an order:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Take an equalizer--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane reached for his belt pouch, flushing, fiercely determined inside\r\n",
      "himself, that no matter how smells warred about him that day, he was not\r\n",
      "going to let it bother him. He swallowed the tiny pellet Medic Tau had\r\n",
      "prepared for just such trials and tried to occupy his mind with the work\r\n",
      "to come. If there would be any work--or would another long day be wasted\r\n",
      "in futile speeches of mutual esteem which gave formal lip service to\r\n",
      "Trade and its manifest benefits?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Houuuu--\" The cry which was half wail, half arrogant warning, sounded\r\n",
      "along the road behind them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Van Rycke's stride did not vary. He did not turn his head, show any sign\r\n",
      "he had heard that heralding fanfare for a clan chieftain. And he\r\n",
      "continued to keep to the exact center of the road, Dane the regulation\r\n",
      "one pace to the rear and left as befitted his lower rank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Houuu--\" that blast from the throat of a Salarik especially chosen for\r\n",
      "his lung power was accompanied now by the hollow drum of many feet. The\r\n",
      "Terrans neither looked around nor withdrew from the center, nor did their\r\n",
      "pace quicken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That, too, was in order, Dane knew. To the rank conscious Salariki\r\n",
      "clansmen you did not yield precedence unless you wanted at once to\r\n",
      "acknowledge your inferiority--and if you did that by some slip of\r\n",
      "admission or omission, there was no use in trying to treat face to face\r\n",
      "with their chieftains again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Houuu--!\" The blast behind was a scream as the retinue it announced\r\n",
      "swept around the bend in the road to catch sight of the two Traders\r\n",
      "oblivious of it. Dane longed to be able to turn his head, just enough to\r\n",
      "see which one of the local lordlings they blocked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Houu--\" there was a questioning note in the cry now and the heavy\r\n",
      "thud-thud of feet was slacking. The clan party had seen them, were\r\n",
      "hesitant about the wisdom of trying to shove them aside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Van Rycke marched steadily onward and Dane matched his pace. They might\r\n",
      "not possess a leather-lunged herald to clear their road, but they gave\r\n",
      "every indication of having the right to occupy as much of it as they\r\n",
      "wished. And that unruffled poise had its affect upon those behind. The\r\n",
      "pound of feet slowed to a walk, a walk which would keep a careful\r\n",
      "distance behind the two Terrans. It had worked--the Salariki--or these\r\n",
      "Salariki--were accepting them at their own valuation--a good omen for the\r\n",
      "day's business. Dane's spirits rose, but he schooled his features into a\r\n",
      "mask as wooden as his superior's. After all this was a very minor victory\r\n",
      "and they had ten or twelve hours of polite, and hidden, maneuvering\r\n",
      "before them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Solar Queen had set down as closely as possible to the trading center\r\n",
      "marked on Traxt Cam's private map and the Terrans now had another five\r\n",
      "minutes march, in the middle of the road, ahead of the chieftain who must\r\n",
      "be inwardly boiling at their presence, before they came out in the\r\n",
      "clearing containing the roofless, circular erection which served the\r\n",
      "Salariki of the district as a market place and a common meeting ground\r\n",
      "for truce talks and the mending of private clan alliances. Erect on a\r\n",
      "pole in the middle, towering well above the nodding fronds of the grass\r\n",
      "trees, was the pole bearing the trade shield which promised not only\r\n",
      "peace to those under it, but a three day sanctuary to any feuder or\r\n",
      "duelist who managed to win to it and lay hands upon its weathered\r\n",
      "standard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were not the first to arrive, which was also a good thing. Gathered\r\n",
      "in small groups about the walls of the council place were the personal\r\n",
      "attendants, liege warriors, and younger relatives of at least four or\r\n",
      "five clan chieftains. But, Dane noted at once, there was not a single\r\n",
      "curtained litter or riding orgel to be seen. None of the feminine part of\r\n",
      "the Salariki species had arrived. Nor would they until the final trade\r\n",
      "treaty was concluded and established by their fathers, husbands, or sons.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With the assurance of one who was master in his own clan, Van Rycke,\r\n",
      "displaying no interest at all in the shifting mass of lower rank\r\n",
      "Salariki, marched straight on to the door of the enclosure. Two or three\r\n",
      "of the younger warriors got to their feet, their brilliant cloaks\r\n",
      "flicking out like spreading wings. But when Van Rycke did not even lift\r\n",
      "an eyelid in their direction, they made no move to block his path.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As fighting men, Dane thought, trying to study the specimens before him\r\n",
      "with a totally impersonal stare, the Salariki were an impressive lot.\r\n",
      "Their average height was close to six feet, their distant feline ancestry\r\n",
      "apparent only in small vestiges. A Salarik's nails on both hands and feet\r\n",
      "were retractile, his skin was gray, his thick hair, close to the texture\r\n",
      "of plushy fur, extended down his backbone and along the outside of his\r\n",
      "well muscled arms and legs, and was tawny-yellow, blue-gray or white. To\r\n",
      "Terran eyes the broad faces, now all turned in their direction, lacked\r\n",
      "readable expression. The eyes were large and set slightly aslant in the\r\n",
      "skull, being startlingly orange-red or a brilliant turquoise green-blue.\r\n",
      "They wore loin cloths of brightly dyed fabrics with wide sashes forming\r\n",
      "corselets about their slender middles, from which gleamed the gem-set\r\n",
      "hilts of their claw knives, the possession of which proved their\r\n",
      "adulthood. Cloaks as flamboyant as their other garments hung in bat wing\r\n",
      "folds from their shoulders and each and every one moved in an invisible\r\n",
      "cloud of perfume.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brilliant as the assemblage of liege men without had been, the gathering\r\n",
      "of clan leaders and their upper officers within the council place was a\r\n",
      "riot of color--and odor. The chieftains were installed on the wooden\r\n",
      "stools, each with a small table before him on which rested a goblet\r\n",
      "bearing his own clan sign, a folded strip of patterned cloth--his \"trade\r\n",
      "shield\"--and a gemmed box containing the scented paste he would use for\r\n",
      "refreshment during the ordeal of conference.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A breeze fluttered sash ends and tugged at cloaks, otherwise the assembly\r\n",
      "was motionless and awesomely quiet. Still making no overtures Van Rycke\r\n",
      "crossed to a stool and table which stood a little apart and seated\r\n",
      "himself. Dane went into the action required of him. Before his superior\r\n",
      "he set out a plastic pocket flask, its color as alive in the sunlight as\r\n",
      "the crudely cut gems which the Salariki sported, a fine silk\r\n",
      "handkerchief, and, last of all, a bottle of Terran smelling salts\r\n",
      "provided by Medic Tau as a necessary restorative after some hours\r\n",
      "combination of Salariki oratory and Salariki perfumes. Having thus done\r\n",
      "the duty of liege man, Dane was at liberty to seat himself, cross-legged\r\n",
      "on the ground behind his chief, as the other sons, heirs, and advisors\r\n",
      "had gathered behind their lords.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The chieftain whose arrival they had in a manner delayed came in after\r\n",
      "them and Dane saw that it was Fashdor--another piece of luck--since that\r\n",
      "clan was a small one and the chieftain had little influence. Had they so\r\n",
      "slowed Halfer or Paft it might be a different matter altogether.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fashdor was established at his seat, his belongings spread out, and Dane,\r\n",
      "counting unobtrusively, was certain that the council was now complete.\r\n",
      "Seven clans Traxt Cam had recorded divided the sea coast territory and\r\n",
      "there were seven chieftains here--indicative of the importance of this\r\n",
      "meeting since some of these clans beyond the radius of the shield peace,\r\n",
      "must be fighting a vicious blood feud at that very moment. Yes, seven\r\n",
      "were here. Yet there still remained a single stool, directly across the\r\n",
      "circle from Van Rycke. An empty stool--who was the late comer?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That question was answered almost as it flashed into Dane's mind. But no\r\n",
      "Salariki lordling came through the door. Dane's self-control kept him in\r\n",
      "his place, even after he caught the meaning of the insignia emblazoned\r\n",
      "across the newcomer's tunic. Trader--and not only a Trader but a Company\r\n",
      "man! But why--and how? The Companies only went after big game--this was a\r\n",
      "planet thrown open to Free Traders, the independents of the star lanes.\r\n",
      "By law and right no Company man had any place here. Unless--behind a face\r\n",
      "Dane strove to keep as impassive as Van's his thoughts raced. Traxt Cam\r\n",
      "as a Free Trader had bid for the right to exploit Sargol when its sole\r\n",
      "exportable product was deemed to be perfume--a small, unimportant trade\r\n",
      "as far as the Companies were concerned. And then the Koros stones had\r\n",
      "been found and the importance of Sargol must have boomed as far as the\r\n",
      "big boys could see. They probably knew of Traxt Cam's death as soon as\r\n",
      "the Patrol report on Limbo had been sent to Headquarters. The Companies\r\n",
      "all maintained their private information and espionage services. And,\r\n",
      "with Traxt Cam dead without an heir, they had seen their chance and moved\r\n",
      "in. Only, Dane's teeth set firmly, they didn't have the ghost of a chance\r\n",
      "now. Legally there was only one Trader on Sargol and that was the Solar\r\n",
      "Queen, Captain Jellico had his records signed by the Patrol to prove\r\n",
      "that. And all this Inter-Solar man would do now was to bow out and try\r\n",
      "poaching elsewhere.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the I-S man appeared to be in no haste to follow that only possible\r\n",
      "course. He was seating himself with arrogant dignity on that unoccupied\r\n",
      "stool, and a younger man in I-S uniform was putting before him the same\r\n",
      "type of equipment Dane had produced for Van Rycke. The Cargo-master of\r\n",
      "the Solar Queen showed no surprise, if the Eysies' appearance had been\r\n",
      "such to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the younger warriors in Paft's train got to his feet and brought\r\n",
      "his hands together with a clap which echoed across the silent gathering\r\n",
      "with the force of an archaic solid projectal shot. A Salarik, wearing the\r\n",
      "rich dress of the upper ranks, but also the collar forced upon a captive\r\n",
      "taken in combat, came into the enclosure carrying a jug in both hands.\r\n",
      "Preceded by Paft's son he made the rounds of the assembly pouring a\r\n",
      "purple liquid from his jug into the goblet before each chieftain, a\r\n",
      "goblet which Paft's heirs tasted ceremoniously before it was presented to\r\n",
      "the visiting clan leader. When they paused before Van Rycke the Salarik\r\n",
      "nobleman touched the side of the plasta flask in token. It was recognized\r\n",
      "that off world men must be cautious over the sampling of local products\r\n",
      "and that when they joined in the Taking of the First Cup of Peace, they\r\n",
      "did so symbolically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Paft raised his cup, his gesture copied by everyone around the circle. In\r\n",
      "the harsh tongue of his race he repeated a formula so archaic that few of\r\n",
      "the Salariki could now translate the sing-song words. They drank and the\r\n",
      "meeting was formally opened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it was an elderly Salarik seated to the right of Halfer, a man who\r\n",
      "wore no claw knife and whose dusky yellow cloak and sash made a subdued\r\n",
      "note amid the splendor of his fellows, who spoke first, using the\r\n",
      "click-clack of the Trade Lingo his nation had learned from Cam.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Under the white,\" he pointed to the shield aloft, \"we assemble to hear\r\n",
      "many things. But now come two tongues to speak where once there was but\r\n",
      "one father of a clan. Tell us, outlanders, which of you must we now hark\r\n",
      "to in truth?\" He looked from Van Rycke to the I-S representative.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Cargo-master from the Queen did not reply. He stared across the\r\n",
      "circle at the Company man. Dane waited eagerly. What _was_ the I-S going\r\n",
      "to say to that?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the fellow did have an answer, ready and waiting. \"It is true,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You can't expect to buck Inter-Solar. We'll make you an offer--\" That\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Jellico, whose forté was more direct action, took an excursion into\r\n",
      "heavy-handed sarcasm. \"You Eysies have certainly been given excellent\r\n",

      "sections in small symbols at the end of the tape, either! _We're_ not\r\n",
      "bucking anyone. You'll find our registration for Sargol down on tapes at\r\n",

      "which they were able to assess correctly. The Solar Queen was a Free\r\n",
      "Trader, alone on an alien world. But the I-S ship might be cruising in\r\n",
      "company, ready to summon aid, men and supplies. Dane drew a deep breath,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Your proposition?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps this return to their implied threat bolstered their belief in the\r\n",
      "infallibility of the Company, their conviction that no independent dared\r\n",
      "stand up against the might and power of Inter-Solar. Kallee replied:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We'll take up your contract, at a profit to you, and you up-ship before\r\n",
      "the Salariki are confused over whom they are to deal with--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And the amount of profit?\" Van Rycke bored in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh,\" Kallee shrugged, \"say ten percent of Cam's last shipment--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jellico laughed. \"Generous, aren't you, Eysie? Ten percent of a cargo\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "Now Van Rycke chucked. \"I wonder who figured that one out?\" he inquired\r\n",

      "one way or another. Interesting offer--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By the bland satisfaction to be read on the three faces below the I-S men\r\n",
      "were assured of their victory. The Solar Queen would be paid off with a\r\n",
      "pittance, under the vague threat of Company retaliation she would\r\n",
      "up-ship from Sargol, and they would be left in possession of the rich\r\n",
      "Koros trade--to be commended and rewarded by their superiors. Had they,\r\n",
      "Dane speculated, ever had any dealings with Free Traders before--at least\r\n",
      "with the brand of independent adventurers such as manned the Solar Queen?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Van Rycke burrowed in his belt pouch and then held out his hand. On the\r\n",
      "broad palm lay a flat disc of metal. \"Very interesting--\" he repeated. \"I\r\n",
      "shall treasure this recording--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sight of that disc wiped all satisfaction from the Eysie faces.\r\n",
      "Grange's purplish flush spread up from his tight tunic collar, Kallee\r\n",
      "blinked, and the unknown third's hand dropped to his sleep rod. An action\r\n",
      "which was not overlooked by either Dane or Ali.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A smooth set down to you,\" Jellico gave the conventional leave taking of\r\n",
      "the Service.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'd better--\" the Eysie Captain began hotly, and then seeing the disc\r\n",
      "Van Rycke held--that sensitive bit of metal and plastic which was\r\n",
      "recording this interview for future reference, he shut his mouth tight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes?\" the Queen's Cargo-master prompted politely. But Kallee had taken\r\n",
      "his Captain's arm and was urging Grange away from the spacer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You have until noon to lift,\" was Jellico's parting shot as the three in\r\n",
      "Company livery started toward the road.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't think that they will,\" he added to Van Rycke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Cargo-master nodded. \"You wouldn't in their place,\" he pointed out\r\n",
      "reasonably. \"On the other hand they've had a bit of a blast they weren't\r\n",
      "expecting. It's been a long time since Grange heard anyone say 'no.'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A shock which is going to wear off,\" Jellico's habitual distrust of the\r\n",
      "future gathered force.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This,\" Van Rycke tucked the disc back into his pouch, \"sent them off\r\n",
      "vector a parsec or two. Grange is not one of the strong arm blaster\r\n",
      "boys. Suppose Tang Ya does a little listening in--and maybe we can rig\r\n",
      "another surprise if Grange does try to ask advice of someone off world.\r\n",
      "In the meantime I don't think they are going to meddle with the Salariki.\r\n",
      "They don't want to have to answer awkward questions if _we_ turn up a\r\n",
      "Patrol ship to ask them. So--\" he stretched and beckoned to Dane, \"we\r\n",
      "shall go to work once more.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again two paces behind Van Rycke Dane tramped to the trade circle of the\r\n",
      "Salariki clansmen. They might have walked out only five or six minutes of\r\n",
      "ship time before, and the natives betrayed no particular interest in\r\n",
      "their return. But, Dane noted, there was only one empty stool, one\r\n",
      "ceremonial table in evidence. The Salariki had expected only one Terran\r\n",
      "Trader to join them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What followed was a dreary round of ceremony, an exchange of platitudes\r\n",
      "and empty good wishes and greetings. No one mentioned Koros stones--or\r\n",
      "even perfume bark--that he was willing to offer the off-world traders.\r\n",
      "None lifted so much as a corner of his trade cloth, under which, if he\r\n",
      "were ready to deal seriously, his hidden hand would meet that of the\r\n",
      "buyer, so that by finger pressure alone they could agree or disagree on\r\n",
      "price. But such boring sessions were part of Trade and Dane, keeping a\r\n",
      "fraction of attention on the speeches and \"drinkings-together,\" watched\r\n",
      "those around him with an eye which tried to assess and classify what he\r\n",
      "saw.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The keynote of the Salariki character was a wary independence. The only\r\n",
      "form of government they would tolerate was a family-clan organization.\r\n",
      "Feuds and deadly duels between individuals and clans were the accepted\r\n",
      "way of life and every male who reached adulthood went armed and ready for\r\n",
      "combat until he became a \"Speaker for the past\"--too old to bear arms in\r\n",
      "the field. Due to the nature of their battling lives, relatively few of\r\n",
      "the Salariki ever reached that retirement. Short-lived alliances between\r\n",
      "families sometimes occurred, usually when they were to face a common\r\n",
      "enemy greater than either. But a quarrel between chieftains, a fancied\r\n",
      "insult would rip that open in an instant. Only under the Trade Shield\r\n",
      "could seven clans sit this way without their warriors being at one\r\n",
      "another's furred throats.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An hour before sunset Paft turned his goblet upside down on his table, a\r\n",
      "move followed speedily by every chieftain in the circle. The conference\r\n",
      "was at an end for that day. And as far as Dane could see it had\r\n",

      "hours were the best time on Sargol. The light was golden, the night winds\r\n",
      "had not yet arisen. He disliked exchanging the freedom of the open for\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And, as he hesitated there, two of the juvenile population of Sargol came\r\n",

      "net which now enclosed a quiet but baneful eyed captive--Sinbad being\r\n",
      "delivered for nightly ransom. Dane was reaching for the pay to give the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "For one of the Salariki, who had continually manifested their belief that\r\n",
      "Terrans and their ship were an offence to the nostrils of all right\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Only one of the junior clansmen obeyed that invitation. The other\r\n",

      "crew knew the necessity for making some sort of contact with the natives.\r\n",
      "Mura did not even nod, but squeezed by the Salarik and pressed the lock.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The cub remained where he was, his head up, his wide nostrils visibly\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Sinbad kicked and growled. This was his private hunting ground--the\r\n",
      "preserve he kept free of invaders. Dane put the cat down. The Salarik had\r\n",
      "found what he was seeking. He stood on tiptoe to sniff at a plant, his\r\n",
      "yellow eyes half closed, his whole stance spelling ecstasy. Dane looked\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Catnip?\" Dane repeated. The word meant nothing to him, but Mura had a\r\n",

      "is it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"One of the Terran mints--an herb,\" Mura gave a short explanation as he\r\n",
      "moved down the aisle toward the alien. He broke off a leaf and crushed it\r\n",
      "between his fingers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane, his sense of smell largely deadened by the pungency with which he\r\n",
      "had been surrounded by most of that day, could distinguish no new odor.\r\n",
      "But the young Salarik swung around to face the steward his eyes wide, his\r\n",
      "nose questing. And Sinbad gave a whining yowl and made a spring to push\r\n",
      "his head against the steward's now aromatic hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So--now they had it--an opening wedge. Dane came up to the three.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All right to take a leaf or two?\" he asked Mura.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why not? I grow it for Sinbad. To a cat it is like heemel smoke or a\r\n",
      "tankard of lackibod.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And by Sinbad's actions Dane guessed that the plant did hold for the cat\r\n",
      "the same attraction those stimulants produced in human beings. He\r\n",
      "carefully broke off a small stem supporting three leaves and presented it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Dane heard the pad of his feet on the ladder--apparently the cub was\r\n",
      "making sure of escape with his precious find. But the Cargo-master\r\n",
      "apprentice was frowning. As far as he could see there were only five of\r\n",
      "the plants.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's all the catnip you have?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "hydro. \"There was no need to grow more. A small portion of the herb goes\r\n",
      "a long way with this one,\" he put the cat down in the corridor. \"The\r\n",
      "leaves may be preserved by drying. I believe that there is a small box of\r\n",
      "them in the galley.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But to Dane's growing discomfiture the Cargo-master showed no elation as\r\n",
      "his junior poured out the particulars of his discovery. Instead there\r\n",
      "were definite signs of displeasure to be read by those who knew Van Rycke\r\n",
      "well. He heard Dane out and then got to his feet. Tolling the younger man\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Problem for you, Craig.\" Van Rycke seated his bulk on the wall jump seat\r\n",
      "Tau pulled down for him. Dane was left standing just within the door,\r\n",
      "very sure now that instead of being commended for his discovery of a few\r\n",
      "minutes before, he was about to suffer some reprimand. And the reason for\r\n",
      "it still eluded him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you know about that plant Mura grows in the hydro--the one\r\n",
      "called 'catnip'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tau did not appear surprised at that demand--the Medic of a Free Trading\r\n",
      "spacer was never surprised at anything. He had his surfeit of shocks\r\n",
      "during his first years of service and after that accepted any occurrence,\r\n",
      "no matter how weird, as matter-of-fact. In addition Tau's hobby was\r\n",
      "\"magic,\" the hidden knowledge possessed and used by witch doctors and\r\n",
      "medicine men on alien worlds. He had a library of recordings, odd scraps\r\n",
      "of information, of certified results of certain very peculiar\r\n",
      "experiments. Now and then he wrote a report which was sent into Central\r\n",
      "Service, read with raised eyebrows by perhaps half a dozen incredulous\r\n",
      "desk warmers, and filed away to be safely forgotten. But even that had\r\n",
      "ceased to frustrate him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's an herb of the mint family from Terra,\" he replied. \"Mura grows it\r\n",
      "for Sinbad--has quite a marked influence on cats. Frank's been trying to\r\n",
      "keep him anchored to the ship by allowing him to roll in fresh leaves. He\r\n",
      "does it--then continues to sneak out whenever he can--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That explained something for Dane--why the Salariki cub wished to enter\r\n",
      "the Queen tonight. Some of the scent of the plant had clung to Sinbad's\r\n",
      "fur, had been detected, and the Salarik had wanted to trace it to its\r\n",
      "source.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is it a drug?\" Van Rycke prodded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In the way that all herbs are drugs. Human beings have dosed themselves\r\n",
      "in the past with a tea made of the dried leaves. It has no great\r\n",
      "medicinal properties. To felines it is a stimulation--and they get the\r\n",
      "same satisfaction from rolling in and eating the leaves as we do from\r\n",
      "drinking--\"\r\n",

      "\"The Salariki are, in a manner of speaking, felines--\" Van Rycke mused.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Van Rycke nodded at Dane and for the second time the Cargo-master\r\n",
      "apprentice made his report. When he was done Van Rycke asked a direct\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"What effect would catnip have on a Salarik?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was only then that Dane grasped the enormity of what he had done. They\r\n",
      "had no way of gauging the influence of an off-world plant on alien\r\n",
      "metabolism. What if he had introduced to the natives of Sargol a\r\n",
      "dangerous drug--started that cub on some path of addiction. He was cold\r\n",
      "inside. Why, he might even have poisoned the child!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tau picked up his cap, and after a second's hesitation, his emergency\r\n",
      "medical kit. He had only one question for Dane.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Any idea of who the cub is--what clan he belongs to?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Dane, chill with real fear, was forced to answer in the negative.\r\n",
      "What _had_ he done!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Can you find him?\" Van Rycke, ignoring Dane, spoke to Tau.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Medic shrugged. \"I can try. I was out scouting this morning--met one\r\n",
      "of the storm priests who handles their medical work. But I wasn't\r\n",
      "welcomed. However, under the circumstances, we have to try something--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the corridor Van Rycke had an order for Dane. \"I suggest that you keep\r\n",
      "to quarters, Thorson, until we know how matters stand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane saluted. That note in his superior's voice was like a whip\r\n",
      "lash--much worse to take than the abuse of a lesser man. He swallowed as\r\n",
      "he shut himself into his own cramped cubby. This might be the end of\r\n",
      "their venture. And they would be lucky if their charter was not\r\n",
      "withdrawn. Let I-S get an inkling of his rash action and the Company\r\n",
      "would have them up before the Board to be stripped of all their rights\r\n",
      "in the Service. Just because of his own stupidity--his pride in being\r\n",
      "able to break through where Van Rycke and the Captain had faced a stone\r\n",
      "wall. And, worse than the future which could face the Queen, was the\r\n",
      "thought that he might have introduced some dangerous drug into Sargol\r\n",
      "with his gift of those few leaves. When would he learn? He threw himself\r\n",
      "face down on his bunk and despondently pictured the string of calamities\r\n",
      "which could and maybe would stem from his thoughtless and hasty action.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Within the Queen night and day were mechanical--the lighting in the\r\n",

      "What he saw below brought him up short. Evening had come to Sargol but\r\n",
      "the scene immediately below was not in darkness. Blazing torches\r\n",
      "advanced in lines from the grass forest and the portable flood light of\r\n",
      "the spacer added to the general glare, turning night into noonday.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Van Rycke and Jellico sat on stools facing at least five of the seven\r\n",
      "major chieftains with whom they had conferred to no purpose earlier. And\r\n",
      "behind these leaders milled a throng of lesser Salariki. Yes, there was\r\n",
      "at least one carrying chair--and also an orgel from the back of which a\r\n",
      "veiled noblewoman was being assisted to dismount by two retainers. The\r\n",
      "women of the clans were coming--which could mean only that trade was at\r\n",
      "last in progress. But trade for what?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane strode down the ramp. He saw Paft, his hand carefully covered by his\r\n",
      "trade cloth, advance to Van Rycke, whose own fingers were decently veiled\r\n",
      "by a handkerchief. Under the folds of fabric their hands touched. The\r\n",
      "bargaining was in the first stages. And it was important enough for the\r\n",
      "clan leaders to conduct themselves. Where, according to Cam's records, it\r\n",
      "had been usual to delegate that power to a favored liege man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Catching the light from the ship's beam and from the softer flares of the\r\n",
      "Salariki torches was a small pile of stones resting on a stool to one\r\n",
      "side. Dane drew a deep breath. He had heard the Koros stones described,\r\n",
      "had seen the tri-dee print of one found among Cam's recordings but the\r\n",
      "reality was beyond his expectations. He knew the technical analysis of\r\n",
      "the gems--that they were, as the amber of Terra, the fossilized resin\r\n",
      "exuded by ancient plants (maybe the ancestors of the grass trees) long\r\n",
      "buried in the saline deposits of the shallow seas where chemical changes\r\n",
      "had taken place to produce the wonder jewels. In color they shaded from a\r\n",
      "rosy apricot to a rich mauve, but in their depths other colors, silver,\r\n",
      "fiery gold, spun sparks which seemed to move as the gem was turned.\r\n",
      "And--which was what first endeared them to the Salariki--when worn\r\n",
      "against the skin and warmed by body heat they gave off a perfume which\r\n",
      "enchanted not only the Sargolian natives but all in the Galaxy wealthy\r\n",
      "enough to own one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On another stool placed at Van Rycke's right hand, as that bearing the\r\n",
      "Koros stones was at Paft's, was a transparent plastic box containing some\r\n",
      "wrinkled brownish leaves. Dane moved as unobtrusively as he could to his\r\n",
      "proper place at such a trading session, behind Van Rycke. More Salariki\r\n",
      "were tramping out of the forest, torch bearing retainers and cloaked\r\n",
      "warriors. A little to one side was a third party Dane had not seen\r\n",
      "before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were clustered about a staff which had been driven into the ground,\r\n",
      "a staff topped with a white streamer marking a temporary trading ground.\r\n",
      "These were Salariki right enough but they did not wear the colorful garb\r\n",
      "of those about them, instead they were all clad alike in muffling,\r\n",
      "sleeved robes of a drab green--the storm priests--their robes denoting\r\n",
      "the color of the Sargolian sky just before the onslaught of their worst\r\n",
      "tempests. Cam had not left many clues concerning the religion of the\r\n",
      "Salariki, but the storm priests had, in narrowly defined limits, power,\r\n",
      "and their recognition of the Terran Traders would add to good feeling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the knot of storm priests a Terran stood--Medic Tau--and he was\r\n",
      "talking earnestly with the leader of the religious party. Dane would have\r\n",
      "given much to have been free to cross and ask Tau a question or two. Was\r\n",
      "all this assembly the result of the discovery in the hydro? But even as\r\n",
      "he asked himself that, the trade cloths were shaken from the hands of the\r\n",
      "bargainers and Van Rycke gave an order over his shoulder.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "His sarcasm did not register with Weeks for the little man pushed by Dane\r\n",
      "and left the cabin to their surprise. In the quiet which followed they\r\n",
      "could hear the clatter of his boots on ladder rungs as he descended to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"What's he going for?\"\r\n",

      "the cramped quarters of the spacer very little about him as an individual\r\n",
      "impressed his mates--a fact which was slowly dawning on them all now.\r\n",
      "Then they heard the scramble of feet hurrying back and Weeks burst in\r\n",
      "with energy which carried him across to the table behind which the\r\n",
      "Captain and Van Rycke now sat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the wiper's hands was a plasta-steel box--the treasure chest of a\r\n",
      "spaceman. Its tough exterior was guaranteed to protect the contents\r\n",
      "against everything but outright disintegration. Weeks put it down on the\r\n",
      "table and snapped up the lid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A new aroma, or aromas, was added to the scents now at war in the cabin.\r\n",
      "Weeks pulled out a handful of fluffy white stuff which frothed up about\r\n",
      "his fingers like soap lather. Then with more care he lifted up a tray\r\n",
      "divided into many small compartments, each with a separate sealing lid of\r\n",
      "its own. The men of the Queen moved in, their curiosity aroused, until\r\n",
      "they were jostling one another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Being tall Dane had an advantage, though Van Rycke's bulk and the wide\r\n",
      "shoulders of the Captain were between him and the object they were so\r\n",
      "intent upon. In each division of the tray, easily seen through the\r\n",
      "transparent lids, was a carved figure. The weird denizens of the Venusian\r\n",
      "polar swamps were there, along with lifelike effigies of Terran animals,\r\n",
      "a Martian sand-mouse in all its monstrous ferocity, and the native animal\r\n",
      "and reptile life of half a hundred different worlds. Weeks put down a\r\n",
      "second tray beside the first, again displaying a menagerie of strange\r\n",
      "life forms. But when he clicked open one of the compartments and handed\r\n",
      "the figurine it contained to the Captain, Dane understood the reason for\r\n",
      "now bringing forward the carvings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The majority of them were fashioned from a dull blue-gray wood and Dane\r\n",
      "knew that if he picked one up he would discover that it weighed close to\r\n",
      "nothing in his hand. That was lacquel bark--the aromatic product of a\r\n",
      "Venusian vine. And each little animal or reptile lay encased in a soft\r\n",
      "dab of frothy white--frosh weed--the perfumed seed casing of the Martian\r\n",
      "canal plants. One or two figures on the second tray were of a red-brown\r\n",
      "wood and these Van Rycke sniffed at appreciatively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Cedar--Terran cedar,\" he murmured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Weeks nodded eagerly, his eyes alight. \"I am waiting now for\r\n",
      "sandalwood--it is also good for carving--\"\r\n",

      "Jellico stared at the array in puzzled wonder. \"You have made these?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Being an amateur xenobiologist of no small standing himself, the shapes\r\n",

      "attention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All those on board the Queen had their own hobbies. The monotony of\r\n",
      "voyaging through hyper-space had long ago impressed upon men the need for\r\n",

      "forced into close companionship with few duties to keep them alert.\r\n",
      "Jellico's cabin was papered with tri-dee pictures of the rare animals and\r\n",
      "alien creatures he had studied in their native haunts or of which he kept\r\n",

      "plants but the delicate miniature landscapes he fashioned, to be\r\n",
      "imprisoned forever in the hearts of protecting plasta balls. But Weeks\r\n",
      "had never shown his work before and now he had an artist's supreme\r\n",
      "pleasure of completely confounding his shipmates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Cargo-master returned to the business on hand first. \"You're willing\r\n",

      "right now--well, maybe they'll be worth more to the Queen, seeing as how\r\n",
      "they're made out of aromatic woods, then they'd be elsewhere. Leastwise\r\n",

      "efforts of his liege men on a newly discovered and richly strewn length\r\n",

      "ceremonial Salariki speech, as had never been planned before on the face\r\n",
      "of Sargol. Salariki without number in the past had died beneath the\r\n",
      "ripping talons of the water reptiles, but it was seldom that a chieftain\r\n",

      "betraying another gorp on its way to launch against the rock barrier.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was such wild confusion along that line of water sprayed rocks\r\n",
      "that he had no idea of how the engagement was going. But so far the\r\n",
      "gorp showed no signs of having had enough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane was shaken out of his absorption by another scream. One, he was\r\n",
      "sure, which had not come from any Salariki throat. He got to his\r\n",
      "feet. Rip was stationed four men beyond him. Yes, the tall\r\n",
      "Astrogator-apprentice was there, outlined against torch flare. Ali?\r\n",
      "No--there was the assistant Engineer. Weeks? But Weeks was picking his\r\n",
      "way back along the reef toward the shore, haste expressed in every line\r\n",
      "of his figure. The scream sounded for a second time, freezing the\r\n",
      "Terrans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come back--!\" That was Weeks gesturing violently at the shore and\r\n",
      "something floundering in the protecting circle of the reef. The younger\r\n",
      "Salariki who had been feeding the fire were now clustered at the water's\r\n",
      "edge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ali ran and with a leap covered the last few feet, landing reckless knee\r\n",
      "deep in the waves. Dane saw light strike on his rod as he swung it in a\r\n",
      "wide arc to center on the struggle churning the water into foam. A third\r\n",
      "scream died to a moan and then the Salariki dashed into the sea, their\r\n",
      "nets spread, drawing back with them through the surf a dark and now quiet\r\n",
      "mass.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fact that at least one gorp had managed to get on the inner side of\r\n",
      "the reef made an impression on the rest of the native hunters. After an\r\n",
      "uncertain minute or two Groft gave the signal to withdraw--which they did\r\n",
      "with grisly trophies. Dane counted seven gorp bodies--which did not\r\n",
      "include the prisoner ashore. And more might have slid into the sea to\r\n",
      "die. On the other hand two Salariki were dead--one had been drawn into\r\n",
      "the sea before Dane's eyes--and at least one was badly wounded. But who\r\n",
      "had been pulled down in the shallows--some one sent out from the Queen\r\n",
      "with a message?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane raced back along the reef, not waiting to pull up his torch, and\r\n",
      "before he reached the shore Rip was overtaking him. But the man who lay\r\n",
      "groaning on the sand was not from the Queen. The torn and bloodstained\r\n",
      "tunic covering his lacerated shoulders had the I-S badge. Ali was already\r\n",
      "at work on his wounds, giving temporary first aid from his belt kit. To\r\n",
      "all their questions he was stubbornly silent--either he couldn't or\r\n",
      "wouldn't answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the end they helped the Salariki rig three stretchers. On one the\r\n",
      "largest, the captive gorp, still curled in a round carapace protected\r\n",
      "ball, was bound with the net. The second supported the wounded Salarik\r\n",
      "clansman and onto the third the Terrans lifted the I-S man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We'll deliver him to his own ship,\" Rip decided. \"He must have tailed us\r\n",
      "here as a spy--\" He asked a passing Salarik as to where they could find\r\n",
      "the Company spacer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They might just think we are responsible,\" Ali pointed out. \"But I see\r\n",
      "your point. If we do pack him back to the Queen and he doesn't make it,\r\n",
      "they might say that we fired his rockets for him. All right, boys, let's\r\n",
      "up-ship--he doesn't look too good to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With a torch-bearing Salarik boy as a guide, they hurried along a path\r\n",
      "taking in turns the burden of the stretcher. Luckily the I-S ship was\r\n",
      "even closer to the sea than the Queen and as they crossed the slagged\r\n",
      "ground, congealed by the break fire, they were trotting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though the Company ship was probably one of the smallest Inter-Solar\r\n",
      "carried on her rosters, it was a third again as large as the Queen--with\r\n",
      "part of that third undoubtedly dedicated to extra cargo space. Beside her\r\n",
      "their own spacer would seem not only smaller, but battered and worn. But\r\n",
      "no Free Trader would have willingly assumed the badges of a Company man,\r\n",
      "not even for the command of such a ship fresh from the cradles of a\r\n",
      "builder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When a man went up from the training Pool for his first assignment, he\r\n",
      "was sent to the ship where his temperament, training and abilities best\r\n",
      "fitted. And those who were designated as Free Traders would never fit\r\n",
      "into the pattern of Company men. Of late years the breech between those\r\n",
      "who lived under the strict parental control of one of the five great\r\n",
      "galaxy wide organizations and those still too much of an individual to\r\n",
      "live any life but that of a half-explorer-half-pioneer which was the Free\r\n",
      "Trader's, had widened alarmingly. Antagonism flared, rivalry was strong.\r\n",
      "But as yet the great Companies themselves were at polite cold war with\r\n",
      "one another for the big plums of the scattered systems. The Free Traders\r\n",
      "took the crumbs and there was not much disputing--save in cases such as\r\n",
      "had arisen on Sargol, when suddenly crumbs assumed the guise of very rich\r\n",
      "cake, rich and large enough to attract a giant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The party from the Queen was given a peremptory challenge as they reached\r\n",
      "the other ship's ramp. Rip demanded to see the officer of the watch and\r\n",
      "then told the story of the wounded man as far as they knew it. The Eysie\r\n",
      "was hurried aboard--nor did his shipmates give a word of thanks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's that.\" Rip shrugged. \"Let's go before they slam the hatch so hard\r\n",
      "they'll rock their ship off her fins!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Polite, aren't they?\" asked Weeks mildly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you expect of Eysies?\" Ali wanted to know. \"To them Free Traders\r\n",
      "are just rim planet trash. Let's report back where we are appreciated.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They took a short cut which brought them back to the Queen and they filed\r\n",
      "up her ramp to make their report to the Captain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But they were not yet satisfied with Groft and his gorp slayers. No\r\n",
      "Salarik appeared for trade in the morning--surprising the Terrans.\r\n",
      "Instead a second delegation, this time of older men and a storm priest,\r\n",
      "visited the spacer with an invitation to attend Paft's funeral feast, a\r\n",
      "rite which would be followed by the formal elevation of Groft to his\r\n",
      "father's position, now that he had revenged that parent. And from remarks\r\n",
      "dropped by members of the delegation it was plain that the bearing of the\r\n",
      "Terrans who had joined the hunting party was esteemed to have been in\r\n",
      "highest accord with Salariki tradition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They drew lots to decide which two must remain with the ship and the rest\r\n",
      "perfumed themselves so as to give no offense which might upset their now\r\n",
      "cordial relations. Again it was mid-afternoon when the Salariki escort\r\n",
      "sent to do them honor waited at the edge of the wood and Mura and Tang\r\n",
      "saw them off. With a herald booming before them, they traveled the beaten\r\n",
      "earth road in the opposite direction from the trading center, off through\r\n",
      "the forest until they came to a wide section of several miles which had\r\n",
      "been rigorously cleared of any vegetation which might give cover to a\r\n",
      "lurking enemy. In the center of this was a twelve-foot-high stockade of\r\n",
      "the bright red, burnished wood which had attracted Weeks on the shore.\r\n",
      "Each paling was the trunk of a tree and it had been sharpened at the top\r\n",
      "to a wicked point. On the field side was a wide ditch, crossed at the\r\n",
      "gate by a bridge, the planking of which might be removed at will. And as\r\n",
      "Dane passed over he looked down into the moat that was dry. The Salariki\r\n",
      "did not depend upon water for a defense--but on something else which his\r\n",
      "experience of the previous night had taught him to respect. There was no\r\n",
      "mistaking that shade of purple. The highly inflammable scum the hunters\r\n",
      "had burnt from the top of the waves had been brought inland and lay a\r\n",
      "greasy blanket some eight feet below. It would only be necessary to toss\r\n",
      "a torch on that and the defenders of the stockade would create a wall of\r\n",
      "fire to baffle any attackers. The Salariki knew how to make the most of\r\n",
      "their world's natural resources.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Inside the red stockade there was a crowded community. The Salariki\r\n",
      "demanded privacy of a kind, and even the unmarried warriors did not share\r\n",
      "barracks, but each had a small cubicle of his own. So that the mud brick\r\n",
      "and timber erections of one of their clan cities resembled nothing so\r\n",
      "much as the comb cells of a busy beehive. Although Paft's was considered\r\n",
      "a large clan, it numbered only about two hundred fighting men and their\r\n",
      "numerous wives, children and captive servants. Not all of them normally\r\n",
      "lived at this center, but for the funeral feasting they had\r\n",
      "assembled--which meant a lot of doubling up and tenting out under\r\n",
      "makeshift cover between the regular buildings of the town. So that the\r\n",
      "Terrans were glad to be guided through this crowded maze to the Great\r\n",
      "Hall which was its heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the trading center had been, the hall was a circular enclosure open to\r\n",
      "the sky above but divided in wheel-spoke fashion with posts of the red\r\n",
      "wood, each supporting a metal basket filled with imflammable material.\r\n",
      "Here were no lowly stools or trading tables. One vast circular board,\r\n",
      "broken only by a gap at the foot, ran completely around the wall. At the\r\n",
      "end opposite the entrance was the high chair of the chieftain, set on a\r\n",
      "two step dais. Though the feast had not yet officially begun, the Terrans\r\n",
      "saw that the majority of the places were already occupied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were led around the perimeter of the enclosure to places not far\r\n",
      "from the high seat. Van Rycke settled down with a grunt of satisfaction.\r\n",
      "It was plain that the Free Traders were numbered among the nobility. They\r\n",
      "could be sure of good trade in the days to come.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Delegations from neighboring clans arrived in close companies of ten or\r\n",
      "twelve and were granted seats, as had been the Terrans, in groups. Dane\r\n",
      "noted that there was no intermingling of clan with clan. And, as they\r\n",
      "were to understand later that night, there was a very good reason for\r\n",
      "that precaution.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hope all our adaption shots work,\" Ali murmured, eyeing with no pleasure\r\n",
      "at all the succession of platters now being borne through the inner\r\n",
      "opening of the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the Traders had learned long ago that the wisest part of valor was\r\n",
      "not to sample alien strong drinks, ceremony often required that they\r\n",
      "break bread (or its other world equivalent) on strange planets. And so\r\n",
      "science served expediency and now a Trader bound for any Galactic banquet\r\n",
      "was immunized, as far as was medically possible, against the evil\r\n",
      "consequences of consuming food not originally intended for Terran\r\n",
      "stomachs. One of the results being that Traders acquired a far flung\r\n",
      "reputation of possessing bird-like appetites--since it was always better\r\n",
      "to nibble and live, than to gorge and die.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Groft had not yet taken his place in the vacant chieftain's chair. For\r\n",
      "the present he stood in the center of the table circle, directing the\r\n",
      "captive slaves who circulated with the food. Until the magic moment when\r\n",
      "the clan themselves would proclaim their overlord, he remained merely the\r\n",
      "eldest son of the house, relatively without power.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the endless rows of platters made their way about the table the basket\r\n",
      "lights on the tops of the pillars were ignited, dispelling the dusk of\r\n",
      "evening. And there was an attendant stationed by each to throw on\r\n",
      "handsful of aromatic bark which burned with puffs of lavender smoke,\r\n",
      "adding to the many warring scents. The Terrans had recourse at intervals\r\n",
      "to their own pungent smelling bottles, merely to clear their heads of the\r\n",
      "drugging fumes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Luckily, Dane thought as the feast proceeded, that smoke from the\r\n",
      "braziers went straight up. Had they been in a roofed space they might\r\n",
      "have been overcome. As it was--were they entirely conscious of all that\r\n",
      "was going on around them?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His reason for that speculation was the dance now being performed in the\r\n",
      "center of the hall--their fight with the gorp being enacted in a series\r\n",
      "of bounds and stabbings. He was sure that he could no longer trust his\r\n",
      "eyes when the claw knife of the victorious dancer-hunter apparently\r\n",
      "passed completely through the chest of another wearing a grotesque\r\n",
      "monster mask.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a fitting climax to their horrific display, three of the men who had\r\n",
      "been with them on the reef entered, dragging behind them--still enmeshed\r\n",
      "in the hunting net--the gorp which Dane had stunned. It was uncurled now\r\n",
      "and very much alive, but the pincer claws which might have cut its way\r\n",
      "to safety were encased in balls of hard substance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Freed from the net, suspended by its sealed claws, the gorp swung back\r\n",
      "and forth from a standard set up before the high seat. Its murderous jaws\r\n",
      "snapped futilely, and from it came an enraged snake's vicious hissing.\r\n",
      "Though totally in the power of its enemies it gave an impression of\r\n",
      "terrifying strength and menace.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sight of their ancient foe aroused the Salariki, inflaming warriors\r\n",
      "who leaned across the table to hurl tongue-twisting invective at the\r\n",
      "captive monster. Dane gathered that seldom had a living gorp been\r\n",
      "delivered helpless into their hands and they proposed to make the most of\r\n",
      "this wonderful opportunity. And the Terran suddenly wished the\r\n",
      "monstrosity had fallen back into the sea. He had no soft thoughts for the\r\n",
      "gorp after what he had seen at the reef and the tales he had heard, but\r\n",
      "neither did he like what he saw now expressed in gestures, heard in the\r\n",
      "tones of voices about them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A storm priest put an end to the outcries. His dun cloak making a spot of\r\n",
      "darkness amid all the flashing color, he came straight to the place where\r\n",
      "the gorp swung. As he took his stand before the wriggling creature the\r\n",
      "din gradually faded, the warriors settled back into their seats, a pool\r\n",
      "of quiet spread through the enclosure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Groft came up to take his position beside the priest. With both hands he\r\n",
      "carried a two handled cup. It was not the ornamented goblet which stood\r\n",
      "before each diner, but a manifestly older artifact, fashioned of some\r\n",
      "dull black substance and having the appearance of being even older than\r\n",
      "the hall or town.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the warriors who had helped to bring in the gorp now made a quick\r\n",
      "and accurate cast with a looped rope, snaring the monster's head and\r\n",
      "pulling back almost at a right angle. With deliberation the storm priest\r\n",
      "produced a knife--the first straight bladed weapon Dane had seen on\r\n",
      "Sargol. He made a single thrust in the soft underpart of the gorp's\r\n",
      "throat, catching in the cup he took from Groft some of the ichor which\r\n",
      "spurted from the wound.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The gorp thrashed madly, spattering table and surrounding Salariki with\r\n",
      "its life fluid, but the attention of the crowd was riveted elsewhere.\r\n",
      "Into the old cup the priest poured another substance from a flask brought\r\n",
      "by an underling. He shook the cup back and forth, as if to mix its\r\n",
      "contents thoroughly and then handed it to Groft.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Holding it before him the young chieftain leaped to the table top and so\r\n",
      "to stand before the high seat. There was a hush throughout the enclosure.\r\n",
      "Now even the gorp had ceased its wild struggles and hung limp in its\r\n",
      "bonds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Groft raised the cup above his head and gave a loud shout in the archaic\r\n",
      "language of his clan. He was answered by a chant from the warriors who\r\n",
      "would in battle follow his banner, chant punctuated with the clinking\r\n",
      "slap of knife blades brought down forcibly on the board.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Three times he recited some formula and was answered by the others. Then,\r\n",
      "in another period of sudden quiet, he raised the cup to his lips and\r\n",
      "drank off its contents in a single draught, turning the goblet upside\r\n",
      "down when he had done to prove that not a drop remained within. A shout\r\n",
      "tore through the great hall. The Salariki were all on their feet, waving\r\n",
      "their knives over their heads in honor to their new ruler. And Groft for\r\n",
      "the first time seated himself in the high seat. The clan was no longer\r\n",
      "without a chieftain. Groft held his father's place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Show over?\" Dane heard Stotz murmur and Van Rycke's disappointing reply:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not yet. They'll probably make a night of it. Here comes another round\r\n",
      "of drinks--\"\r\n",

      "and Dane turned to see what had so jarred the usually serene\r\n",
      "Astrogator-apprentice. He was just in time to witness an important piece\r\n",
      "of Sargolian social practice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A young warrior, surely only within a year or so of receiving his knife,\r\n",
      "was facing an older Salarik, both on their feet. The head and shoulder\r\n",
      "fur of the older fighter was dripping wet and an empty goblet rolled\r\n",
      "across the table to bump to the floor. A hush had fallen on the immediate\r\n",
      "neighbors of the pair, and there was an air of expectancy about the\r\n",
      "company.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Threw his drink all over the other fellow,\" Rip's soft whisper\r\n",
      "explained. \"That means a duel--\"\r\n",

      "Salariki.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Should be to the death for an insult such as that,\" Ali remarked, as\r\n",
      "usual surveying the scene from his chosen role as bystander. As a child\r\n",
      "he had survived the unspeakable massacres of the Crater War, nothing had\r\n",

      "on a great many different worlds. \"He'll be mustered out for good before\r\n",
      "he knows what happened to him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The younger Salarik had barked a question at his elder and had been\r\n",
      "promptly answered by that dripping warrior. Now their neighbors came to\r\n",
      "life with an efficiency which suggested that they had been waiting for\r\n",
      "such a move, it had happened so many times that every man knew just the\r\n",
      "right procedure from that point on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "overheard remarks, at least one duel must be staged sometime during the\r\n",
      "festivities. And those not actively engaged did a lot of brisk betting in\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The nobleman in the violet cloak was not one of Groft's liege men, but a\r\n",
      "member of the delegation from another clan. And what he had laid down on\r\n",
      "the table--indicating as he did so his choice as winner in the coming\r\n",
      "combat, the elder warrior--was a small piece of white material on which\r\n",
      "reposed a slightly withered but familiar leaf. The neighbor he wagered\r\n",
      "with, eyed the stake narrowly, bending over to sniff at it, before he\r\n",
      "piled up two gem set armlets, a personal scent box and a thumb ring to\r\n",
      "balance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this practical indication of just how much the Terran herb was\r\n",
      "esteemed Dane regretted anew their earlier ignorance. He glanced along\r\n",
      "the board and saw that Van Rycke had noted that stake and was calling\r\n",
      "their Captain's attention to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But such side issues were forgotten as the duelists vaulted into the\r\n",
      "circle rimmed by the table, a space now vacated for their action. They\r\n",
      "were stripped to their loin cloths, their cloaks thrown aside. Each\r\n",
      "carried his net in his right hand, his claw knife ready in his left. As\r\n",
      "yet the Traders had not seen Salarik against Salarik in action and in\r\n",
      "spite of themselves they edged forward in their seats, as intent as the\r\n",
      "natives upon what was to come. The finer points of the combat were lost\r\n",
      "on them, and they did not understand the drilled casts of the net, which\r\n",
      "had become as formalized through the centuries as the ancient and now\r\n",
      "almost forgotten sword play of their own world. The young Salarik had\r\n",
      "greater agility and speed, but the veteran who faced him had the\r\n",
      "experience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To Terran eyes the duel had some of the weaving, sweeping movements of\r\n",
      "the earlier ritual dance. The swift evasions of the nets were graceful\r\n",
      "and so timed that many times the meshes grazed the skin of the fighter\r\n",
      "who fled entrapment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane believed that the elder man was tiring, and the youngster must have\r\n",
      "shared that opinion. There was a leap to the right, a sudden flurry of\r\n",
      "dart and retreat, and then a net curled high and fell, enfolding flailing\r\n",
      "arms and kicking legs. When the clutch rope was jerked tight, the\r\n",
      "captured youth was thrown off balance. He rolled frenziedly, but there\r\n",
      "was no escaping the imprisoning strands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A shout applauded the victor. He stood now above his captive who lay\r\n",
      "supine, his throat or breast ready for either stroke of the knife his\r\n",
      "captor wished to deliver. But it appeared that the winner was not minded\r\n",
      "to end the encounter with blood. Instead he reached out a long, befurred\r\n",
      "arm, took up a filled goblet from the table and with serious\r\n",
      "deliberation, poured its contents onto the upturned face of the loser.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment there was a dead silence around the feast board and then a\r\n",
      "second roar, to which the honestly relieved Terrans added spurts of\r\n",
      "laughter. The sputtering youth was shaken free of the net and went down\r\n",
      "on his knees, tendering his opponent his knife, which the other thrust\r\n",
      "along with his own into his sash belt. Dane gathered from overheard\r\n",
      "remarks that the younger man was, for a period of time, to be determined\r\n",
      "by clan council, now the servant-slave of his overthrower and that since\r\n",
      "they were closely united by blood ties, this solution was considered\r\n",
      "eminently suitable--though had the elder killed his opponent, no one\r\n",
      "would have thought the worse of him for that deed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the Queen's men who were to provide the next center of attraction.\r\n",
      "Groft climbed down from his high seat and came to face across the board\r\n",
      "those who had accompanied him on the hunt. This time there was no\r\n",
      "escaping the sipping of the potent drink which the new chieftain slopped\r\n",
      "from his own goblet into each of theirs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fiery mouthful almost gagged Dane, but he swallowed manfully and\r\n",
      "hoped for the best as it burned like acid down his throat into his\r\n",
      "middle, there to mix uncomfortably with the viands he had eaten. Weeks'\r\n",
      "thin face looked very white, and Dane noticed with malicious enjoyment,\r\n",
      "that Ali had an unobtrusive grip on the table which made his knuckles\r\n",
      "stand out in polished knobs--proving that there _were_ things which could\r\n",
      "upset the imperturbable Kamil.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fortunately they were _not_ required to empty that flowing bowl in one\r\n",
      "gulp as Groft had done. The ceremonial mouthful was deemed enough and\r\n",
      "Dane sat down thankfully--but with uneasy fears for the future.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Groft had started back to his high seat when there was an interruption\r\n",
      "which had not been foreseen. A messenger threaded his way among the\r\n",
      "serving men and spoke to the chieftain, who glanced at the Terrans and\r\n",
      "then nodded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane, his queasiness growing every second, was not attending until he\r\n",
      "heard a bitten off word from Rip's direction and looked up to see a party\r\n",
      "of I-S men coming into the open space before the high seat. The men from\r\n",
      "the Queen stiffened--there was something in the attitude of the newcomers\r\n",
      "which hinted at trouble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you wish, sky lords?\" That was Groft using the Trade Lingo, his\r\n",
      "eyes half closed as he lolled in his chair of state, almost as if he were\r\n",
      "about to witness some entertainment provided for his pleasure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We wish to offer you the good fortune desires of our hearts--\" That was\r\n",
      "Kallee, the flowery words rolling with the proper accent from his tongue.\r\n",
      "\"And that you shall not forget us--we also offer gifts--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At a gesture from their Cargo-master, the I-S men set down a small chest.\r\n",
      "Groft, his chin resting on a clenched fist, lost none of his lazy air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They are received,\" he retorted with the formal acceptance. \"And no one\r\n",
      "can have too much good fortune. The Howlers of the Black Winds know\r\n",
      "that.\" But he tendered no invitation to join the feast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Kallee did not appear to be disconcerted. His next move was one which\r\n",
      "took his rivals by surprise, in spite of their suspicions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Under the laws of the Fellowship, O, Groft,\" he clung to the formal\r\n",
      "speech, \"I claim redress--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ali's hand moved. Through his growing distress Dane saw Van Rycke's jaw\r\n",
      "tighten, the fighting mask snap back on Captain Jellico's face. Whatever\r\n",
      "came now was real trouble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Groft's eyes flickered over the party from the Queen. Though he had just\r\n",
      "pledged cup friendship with four of them, he had the malicious humor of\r\n",
      "his race. He would make no move to head off what might be coming.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By the right of the knife and the net,\" he intoned, \"you have the power\r\n",
      "to claim personal satisfaction. Where is your enemy?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Kallee turned to face the Free Traders. \"I hereby challenge a champion to\r\n",

      "my champion--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Salariki were getting excited. This was superb entertainment, an\r\n",
      "engagement such as they had never hoped to see--alien against alien. The\r\n",
      "rising murmur of their voices was like the growl of a hunting beast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Groft smiled and the pleasure that expression displayed was neither\r\n",
      "Terran--nor human. But then the clan leader was not either, Dane reminded\r\n",
      "himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Four of these warriors are clan-bound,\" he said. \"But the others may\r\n",
      "produce a champion--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane looked along the line of his comrades--Ali, Rip, Weeks and himself\r\n",
      "had just been ruled out. That left Jellico, Van Rycke, Karl Kosti, the\r\n",
      "giant jetman whose strength they had to rely upon before, Stotz the\r\n",
      "Engineer, Medic Tau and Steen Wilcox. If it were strength alone he would\r\n",
      "have chosen Kosti, but the big man was not too quick a thinker--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jellico got to his feet, the embodiment of a star lane fighting man. In\r\n",
      "the flickering light the scar on his cheek seemed to ripple. \"Who's your\r\n",
      "champion?\" he asked Kallee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Eysie Cargo-master was grinning. He was confident he had pushed them\r\n",
      "into a position from which they could not extricate themselves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You accept challenge?\" he countered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jellico merely repeated his question and Kallee beckoned forward one of\r\n",
      "his men.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Eysie who stepped up was no match for Kosti. He was a slender, almost\r\n",
      "wand-slim young man, whose pleased smirk said that he, too, was about to\r\n",
      "put something over on the notorious Free Traders. Jellico studied him for\r\n",
      "a couple of long seconds during which the hum of Salariki voices was the\r\n",
      "threatening buzz of a disturbed wasps' nest. There was no way out of\r\n",
      "this--to refuse conflict was to lose all they had won with the clansmen.\r\n",
      "And they did not doubt that Kallee had, in some way, triggered the scales\r\n",
      "against them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jellico made the best of it. \"We accept challenge,\" his voice was level.\r\n",
      "\"We, being guesting in Groft's holding, will fight after the manner of\r\n",
      "the Salariki who are proven warriors--\" He paused as roars of pleased\r\n",
      "acknowledgment arose around the board.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Therefore let us follow the custom of warriors and take up the net and\r\n",
      "the knife--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Was there a shade of dismay on Kallee's face?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And the time?\" Groft leaned forward to ask--but his satisfaction at such\r\n",
      "a fine ending for his feast was apparent. This would be talked over by\r\n",
      "every Sargolian for many storm seasons to come!\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "The morning winds rustled through the grass forest and, closer to hand,\r\n",
      "it pulled at the cloaks of the Salariki. Clan nobles sat on stools,\r\n",
      "lesser folk squatted on the trampled stubble of the cleared ground\r\n",
      "outside the stockade. In their many colored splendor the drab tunics of\r\n",
      "the Terrans were a blot of darkness at either end of the makeshift arena\r\n",
      "which had been marked out for them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the conclusion of their conference the Queen's men had been forced\r\n",
      "into a course Jellico had urged from the first. He, and he alone, would\r\n",
      "represent the Free Traders in the coming duel. And now he stood there in\r\n",
      "the early morning, stripped down to shorts and boots, wearing nothing on\r\n",
      "which a net could catch and so trap him. The Free Traders were certain\r\n",
      "that the I-S men having any advantage would press it to the ultimate\r\n",
      "limit and the death of Captain Jellico would make a great impression on\r\n",
      "the Salariki.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jellico was taller than the Eysie who faced him, but almost as lean. Hard\r\n",
      "muscles moved under his skin, pale where space tan had not burned in the\r\n",
      "years of his star voyaging. And his every movement was with the liquid\r\n",
      "grace of a man who, in his time, had been a master of the force blade.\r\n",
      "Now he gripped in his left hand the claw knife given him by Groft himself\r\n",
      "and in the other he looped the throwing rope of the net.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the other end of the field, the Eysie man was industriously moving his\r\n",
      "bootsoles back and forth across the ground, intent upon coating them with\r\n",
      "as much of the gritty sand as would adhere. And he displayed the supreme\r\n",
      "confidence in himself which he had shown at the moment of challenge in\r\n",
      "the Great Hall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "None of the Free Trading party made the mistake of trying to give Jellico\r\n",
      "advice. The Captain had not risen to his command without learning his\r\n",
      "duties. And the duties of a Free Trader covered a wide range of knowledge\r\n",
      "and practice. One had to be equally expert with a blaster and a slingshot\r\n",
      "when the occasion demanded. Though Jellico had not fought a Salariki duel\r\n",
      "with net and knife before, he had a deep memory of other weapons, other\r\n",
      "tactics which could be drawn upon and adapted to his present need.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was none of the casual atmosphere which had surrounded the affair\r\n",
      "between the Salariki clansmen in the hall. Here was ceremony. The storm\r\n",
      "priests invoked their own particular grim Providence, and there was an\r\n",
      "oath taken over the weapons of battle. When the actual engagement began\r\n",
      "the betting among the spectators had reached, Dane decided, epic\r\n",
      "proportions. Large sections of Sargolian personal property were due to\r\n",
      "change hands as a result of this encounter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the chief priest gave the order to engage both Terrans advanced from\r\n",
      "their respective ends of the fighting space with the half crouching,\r\n",
      "light footed tread of spacemen. Jellico had pulled his net into as close\r\n",
      "a resemblance to rope as its bulk would allow. The very type of weapon,\r\n",
      "so far removed from any the Traders knew, made it a disadvantage rather\r\n",
      "than an asset.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it was when the Eysie moved out to meet the Captain that Rip's\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"He knows--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane had not needed that bad news to be made vocal. Having seen the\r\n",
      "exploits of the Salariki duelists earlier, he had already caught the\r\n",
      "significance of that glide, of the way the I-S champion carried his net.\r\n",
      "The Eysie had not had any last minute instruction in the use of Sargolian\r\n",
      "weapons--he had practiced and, by his stance, knew enough to make him a\r\n",
      "formidable menace. The clamor about the Queen's party rose as the\r\n",
      "battle-wise eyes of the clansmen noted that and the odds against Jellico\r\n",
      "reached fantastic heights while the hearts of his crew sank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Only Van Rycke was not disturbed. Now and then he raised his smelling\r\n",
      "bottle to his nose with an elegant gesture which matched those of the\r\n",
      "befurred nobility around him, as if not a thought of care ruffled his\r\n",
      "mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Eysie feinted in a opening which was a rather ragged copy of the\r\n",
      "young Salarik's more fluid moves some hours before. But, when the net\r\n",
      "settled, Jellico was simply not there, his quick drop to one knee had\r\n",
      "sent the mesh flailing in an arc over his bowed shoulders with a good six\r\n",
      "inches to spare. And a cry of approval came not only from his comrades,\r\n",
      "but from those natives who had been gamblers enough to venture their\r\n",
      "wagers on his performance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane watched the field and the fighters through a watery film. The\r\n",
      "discomfort he had experienced since downing that mouthful of the cup of\r\n",
      "friendship had tightened into a fist of pain clutching his middle in a\r\n",
      "torturing grip. But he knew he must stick it out until Jellico's ordeal\r\n",
      "was over. Someone stumbled against him and he glanced up to see Ali's\r\n",
      "face, a horrible gray-green under the tan, close to his own. For a moment\r\n",
      "the Engineer-apprentice caught at his arm for support and then with a\r\n",
      "visible effort straightened up. So he wasn't the only one--He looked for\r\n",
      "Rip and Weeks and saw that they, too, were ill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But for a moment all that mattered was the stretch of trampled earth and\r\n",
      "the two men facing each other. The Eysie made another cast and this time,\r\n",
      "although Jellico was not caught, the slap of the mesh raised a red welt\r\n",
      "on his forearm. So far the Captain had been content to play the defensive\r\n",
      "role of retreat, studying his enemy, planning ahead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Eysie plainly thought the game his, that he had only to wait for a\r\n",
      "favorable moment and cinch the victory. Dane began to think it had gone\r\n",
      "on for weary hours. And he was dimly aware that the Salariki were also\r\n",
      "restless. One or two shouted angrily at Jellico in their own tongue.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The end came suddenly. Jellico lost his footing, stumbled, and went down.\r\n",
      "But before his men could move, the Eysie champion bounded forward, his\r\n",
      "net whirling out. Only he never reached the Captain. In the very act of\r\n",
      "falling Jellico had pulled his legs under him so that he was not supine\r\n",
      "but crouched, and his net swept but at ground level, clipping the I-S man\r\n",
      "about the shins, entangling his feet so that he crashed heavily to the\r\n",
      "sod and lay still.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The whip--that Lalox whip trick!\" Wilcox's voice rose triumphantly above\r\n",
      "the babble of the crowd. Using his net as if it had been a thong, Jellico\r\n",
      "had brought down the Eysie with a move the other had not foreseen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Breathing hard, sweat running down his shoulders and making tracks\r\n",
      "through the powdery red dust which streaked him, Jellico got to his feet\r\n",
      "and walked over to the I-S champion who had not moved or made a sound\r\n",
      "since his fall. The Captain went down on one knee to examine him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Kill! Kill!\" That was the Salariki, all their instinctive savagery\r\n",
      "aroused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Jellico spoke to Groft. \"By our customs we do not kill the conquered.\r\n",
      "Let his friends bear him hence.\" He took the claw knife the Eysie still\r\n",
      "clutched in his hand and thrust it into his own belt. Then he faced the\r\n",
      "I-S party and Kallee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Take your man and get out!\" The rein he had kept on his temper these\r\n",
      "past days was growing very thin. \"You've made your last play here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Kallee's thick lips drew back in something close to a Salarik snarl. But\r\n",
      "neither he nor his men made any reply. They bundled up their unconscious\r\n",
      "fighter and disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of their own return to the sanctuary of the Queen Dane had only the\r\n",
      "dimmest of memories afterwards. He had made the privacy of the forest\r\n",
      "road before he yielded to the demands of his outraged interior. And after\r\n",
      "that he had stumbled along with Van Rycke's hand under his arm, knowing\r\n",
      "from other miserable sounds that he was not alone in his torment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was some time later, months he thought when he first roused, that he\r\n",
      "found himself lying in his bunk, feeling very weak and empty as if a\r\n",
      "large section of his middle had been removed, but also at peace with his\r\n",
      "world. As he levered himself up the cabin had a nasty tendency to move\r\n",
      "slowly to the right as if he were a pivot on which it swung, and he had\r\n",
      "all the sensations of being in free fall though the Queen was still\r\n",
      "firmly planeted. But that was only a minor discomfort compared to the\r\n",
      "disturbance he remembered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fed the semi-liquid diet prescribed by Tau and served up by Mura to him\r\n",
      "and his fellow sufferers, he speedily got back his strength. But it had\r\n",
      "been a close call, he did not need Tau's explanation to underline that.\r\n",
      "Weeks had suffered the least of the four, he the most--though none of\r\n",
      "them had had an easy time. And they had been out of circulation three\r\n",
      "days.\r\n",

      "that the brilliant scarlet lengths were hoist into the lower cargo hatch\r\n",
      "and stacked according to the science of stowage. He discovered that Rip\r\n",
      "had been right, the wood for all its incredible hardness was light of\r\n",
      "weight. Weak as he still was he could lift and stow a full sized log with\r\n",
      "no great difficulty. And he thought Weeks was correct in thinking that it\r\n",
      "would sell on their home world. The color was novel, the durability an\r\n",
      "asset--it would not make fortunes as the Koros stones might, but every\r\n",
      "bit of profit helped and this cargo might cover their fielding fees on\r\n",
      "Terra.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sinbad was in the cargo space when the first of the logs came in. With\r\n",
      "his usual curiosity the striped tom cat prowled along the wood, sniffing\r\n",
      "industriously. Suddenly he stopped short, spat and backed away, his spine\r\n",
      "fur a roughened crest. Having backed as far as the inner door he turned\r\n",
      "and slunk out. Puzzled, Dane gave the wood a swift inspection. There were\r\n",
      "no cracks or crevices in the smooth surfaces, but as he stopped over the\r\n",
      "logs he became conscious of a sharp odor. So this was one scent of the\r\n",
      "perfumed planet Sinbad did not like. Dane laughed. Maybe they had better\r\n",
      "have Weeks make a gate of the stuff and slip it across the ramp, keeping\r\n",
      "Sinbad on ship board. Odd--it wasn't an unpleasant odor--at least to him\r\n",
      "it wasn't--just sharp and pungent. He sniffed again and was vaguely\r\n",
      "surprised to discover that it was less noticeable now. Perhaps the wood\r\n",

      "servants bearing between them a chest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "about the offensiveness of the spacer Captain Jellico and Steen Wilcox\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The Terran Traders were protesting some course of action that the\r\n",
      "Salariki were firmly insistent upon. In the end the natives won and Kosti\r\n",
      "was summoned to carry on board the chest which the servants had brought.\r\n",
      "Having seen it carried safely inside the spacer, the aliens departed,\r\n",

      "influence and power would be doubled if they could offer the devout\r\n",
      "certain privileges in the form of Terran plants. Consequently they had\r\n",
      "produced and forced upon the reluctant Van Rycke the Koros collection of\r\n",

      "returned to them in the precious seeds and plants. In vain the\r\n",
      "Cargo-master and Captain had pointed out that Galactic trade was a chancy\r\n",
      "thing at the best, that accident might prevent return of the Queen to\r\n",
      "Sargol. But the priests had remained adamant and saw in all such\r\n",
      "arguments only a devious attempt to raise prices. They quoted in their\r\n",
      "turn the information they had levered out of the Company men--that\r\n",
      "Traders had their code and that once pay had been given in advance the\r\n",
      "contract _must_ be fulfilled. They, and they alone, wanted the full cargo\r\n",
      "of the Queen on her next voyage, and they were taking the one way they\r\n",
      "were sure of achieving that result.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So a fortune in Koros stones which as yet did not rightfully belong to\r\n",
      "the Traders was now in the Queen's strong-room and her crew were pledged\r\n",
      "by the strongest possible tie known in their Service to set down on\r\n",
      "Sargol once more before the allotted time had passed. The Free Traders\r\n",
      "did not like it, there was even a vaguely superstitious feeling that such\r\n",

      "no choice if they wanted to retain their influence with the Salariki.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "Trader did not really dare to have an inelastic contract.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"He says he can deliver. We don't have the headache about setting a\r\n",

      "along.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rip sighed. \"Yes--point her nose.\" He inspected his nails. \"Goodbye,\" he\r\n",
      "added gravely. \"These won't be here by the time we planet here again.\r\n",
      "I'll have my fingers gnawed off to the first knuckle. Well, we lift at\r\n",
      "six hours. Pleasant strap down.\" He drank the last of the stuff in his\r\n",
      "mug, made a face at the flavor, and got to his feet, due back at his post\r\n",
      "in control.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane, free of duty until the ship earthed, drifted back to his own cabin,\r\n",
      "sure of part of a night's undisturbed rest before they blasted off.\r\n",
      "Sinbad was curled on his bunk. For some reason the cat had not been\r\n",
      "prowling the ship before take-off as he usually did. First he had sat on\r\n",
      "Van's desk and now he was here, almost as if he wanted human company.\r\n",
      "Dane picked him up and Sinbad rumbled a purr, arching his head so that it\r\n",
      "rubbed against the young man's chin in an extremely uncharacteristic show\r\n",
      "of affection. Smoothing the fur along the cat's jaw line Dane carried him\r\n",
      "back to the Cargo-master's cabin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With some hesitation he knocked at the panel and did not step in until he\r\n",
      "had Van Rycke's muffled invitation. The Cargo-master was stretched on the\r\n",
      "bunk, two of the take off straps already fastened across his bulk as if\r\n",
      "he intended to sleep through the blast-off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sinbad, sir. Shall I stow him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Van Rycke grunted an assent and Dane dropped the cat in the small hammock\r\n",
      "which was his particular station, fastening the safety cords. For once\r\n",
      "Sinbad made no protest but rolled into a ball and was promptly fast\r\n",
      "asleep. For a moment or two Dane thought about this unnatural behavior\r\n",
      "and wondered if he should call it to the Cargo-master's attention.\r\n",
      "Perhaps on Sargol Sinbad had had _his_ equivalent of a friendship cup\r\n",
      "and needed a check-up by Tau.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stowage correct?\" the question, coming from Van Rycke, was also unusual.\r\n",
      "The seal would not have been put across the hold lock had its contents\r\n",
      "not been checked and rechecked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" Dane replied woodenly, knowing he was still in the outer\r\n",
      "darkness. \"There was just the wood--we stowed it according to chart.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Van Rycke grunted once more. \"Feeling top-layer again?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, sir. Any orders, sir?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No. Blast-off's at six.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, sir.\" Dane left the cabin, closing the panel carefully behind him.\r\n",
      "Would he--or could he--he thought drearily, get back in Van Rycke's\r\n",
      "profit column again? Sargol had been unlucky as far as he was concerned.\r\n",
      "First he had made that stupid mistake and then he got sick and now--And\r\n",
      "now--what _was_ the matter? Was it just the general attack of nerves over\r\n",
      "their voyage and the commitments which forced their haste, or was it\r\n",
      "something else? He could not rid himself of a vague sense that the Queen\r\n",

      "wrestled with the microtapes of old records on his own, painfully\r\n",
      "working out the why and wherefor for any departure from the regular\r\n",
      "procedure. He had no inkling of his own future status--whether the return\r\n",

      "mess cabin, tired after his work with old records, to discover no Mura\r\n",
      "busy in the galley beyond, no brew steaming on the heat coil. Rip sat at\r\n",

      "much while we were down--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was only too true as Dane could now recall. And the fact that the\r\n",
      "steward had not been at the feast, had not sampled native food products,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Dane picked up the microtape he had brought with him and went on down the\r\n",
      "corridor to return it. The panel of the cargo office was ajar and to his\r\n",
      "relief he found Van Rycke out. He shoved the tape back in its case and\r\n",
      "pulled out the next one. Sinbad was there, not in his own private\r\n",
      "hammock, but sprawled out on the Cargo-master's bunk. He watched Dane\r\n",
      "lazily, mouthing a silent mew of welcome. For some reason since they had\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "fingered the label of the tape Dane had just chosen. After a glance at\r\n",
      "the identifying symbol he took it out of his assistant's hand, plopped it\r\n",
      "back in its case, and stood for a moment eyeing the selection of past\r\n",
      "voyage records. With a tongue-click of satisfaction he pulled out another\r\n",
      "and tossed it across the desk to Dane.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"See what you can make out of this tangle,\" he ordered. But Dane's\r\n",
      "shoulders went back as if some weight had been lifted from them. The old\r\n",
      "easiness was still lacking, but he was no longer exiled to the outer\r\n",
      "darkness of Van Rycke's displeasure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Holding the microtape as if it were a first grade Koros stone Dane went\r\n",
      "back to his own cabin, snapped the tape into his reader, adjusted the ear\r\n",
      "buttons and lay back on his bunk to listen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "movement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can't shift him alone,\" Ali stated the obvious. The giant jetman was\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "For a perfectly good reason Dane knew. An assistant--two of the\r\n",

      "after his crewmate in the engineering section.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "disguising the monotonous concentrates to the point they resembled fresh\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "They all breathed a sigh of relief when, after three days, no more signs\r\n",

      "\"What's the matter, boy?\" Dane fondled the cat's ears. \"You haven't got\r\n",
      "a headache--have you?\" In that second a wild surmise came into his mind.\r\n",
      "Sinbad had been planet-side on Sargol as much as he could, and on ship\r\n",
      "board he was equally at home in all their cabins--could he be the carrier\r\n",
      "of the disease?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A good idea--only if it were true, then logically the second victim\r\n",
      "should have been Van, or Dane--whereas Sinbad lingered most of the time\r\n",
      "in their cabins--not Kosti. The cat, as far as he knew, had never shown\r\n",
      "any particular fondness for the jetman and certainly did not sleep in\r\n",
      "Karl's quarters. No--that point did not fit. But he would mention it to\r\n",
      "Tau--no use overlooking anything--no matter how wild.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the sequence of victims which puzzled them all. As far as Tau had\r\n",
      "been able to discover Mura and Kosti had nothing much in common except\r\n",
      "that they were crewmates on the same spacer. They did not bunk in the\r\n",
      "same section, their fields of labor were totally different, they had no\r\n",
      "special food or drink tastes in common, they were not even of the same\r\n",
      "race. Frank Mura was one of the few descendants of a mysterious (or now\r\n",
      "mysterious) people who had had their home on a series of islands in one\r\n",
      "of Terra's seas, islands which almost a hundred years before had been\r\n",
      "swallowed up in a series of world-rending quakes--Japan was the ancient\r\n",
      "name of that nation. While Karl Kosti had come from the once thickly\r\n",
      "populated land masses half the planet away which had borne the\r\n",
      "geographical name of \"Europe.\" No, all the way along the two victims had\r\n",

      "and they were both of Terran birth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tau stirred and sat up, blinking bemusedly at Dane, then pushed back his\r\n",
      "wiry black hair and assumed a measure of alertness. Dane dropped the now\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"There's a chance in that--\" He looked a little less beat and he drank\r\n",
      "thirstily from the mug Dane gave him for the second time. Then he hurried\r\n",
      "out with Sinbad under one arm--bound for his lab.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane slicked up the galley, trying to put things away as neatly as Mura\r\n",
      "kept them. He didn't have much faith in the Sinbad lead, but in this case\r\n",
      "everything must be checked out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the Medic did not appear during the rest of the ship's day Dane was\r\n",
      "not greatly concerned. But he was alerted to trouble when Ali came in\r\n",
      "with an inquiry and a complaint.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Seen anything of Craig?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's in the lab,\" Dane answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He didn't answer my knock,\" Ali protested. \"And Weeks says he hasn't\r\n",
      "been in to see Karl all day--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That did catch Dane's attention. Had his half hunch been right? Was Tau\r\n",
      "on the trail of a discovery which had kept him chained to the lab? But it\r\n",
      "wasn't like the Medic not to look in on his patients.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're sure he isn't in the lab?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I told you that he didn't answer my knock. I didn't open the panel--\"\r\n",
      "But now Ali was already in the corridor heading back the way he had come,\r\n",
      "with Dane on his heels, an unwelcome explanation for that silence in both\r\n",
      "their minds. And their fears were reinforced by what they heard as they\r\n",
      "approached the panel--a low moan wrung out of unbearable pain. Dane\r\n",
      "thrust the sliding door open.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tau had slipped from his stool to the floor. His hands were at his head\r\n",
      "which rolled from side to side as if he were trying to quiet some agony.\r\n",
      "Dane stripped down the Medic's under tunic. There was no need to make a\r\n",
      "careful examination, in the hollow of Craig Tau's throat was the\r\n",
      "tell-tale red blotch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sinbad!\" Dane glanced about the cabin. \"Did Sinbad get out past you?\" he\r\n",
      "demanded of the puzzled Ali.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No--I haven't seen him all day--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet the cat was nowhere in the tiny cabin and it had no concealed hiding\r\n",
      "place. To make doubly sure Dane secured the panel before they carried Tau\r\n",
      "to his bunk. The Medic had blacked out again, passed into the lethargic\r\n",
      "second stage of the malady. At least he was out of the pain which\r\n",
      "appeared to be the worst symptom of the disease.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It must be Sinbad!\" Dane said as he made his report directly to Captain\r\n",
      "Jellico. \"And yet--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, he's been staying in Van's cabin,\" the Captain mused. \"And you've\r\n",
      "handled him, he slept on your bunk. Yet you and Van are all right. I\r\n",
      "don't understand that. Anyway--to be on the safe side--we'd better find\r\n",
      "and isolate him before--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He didn't have to underline any words for the grim-faced men who\r\n",
      "listened. With Tau--their one hope of fighting the disease gone--they had\r\n",
      "a black future facing them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They did not have to search for Sinbad. Dane coming down to his own\r\n",
      "section found the cat crouched before the panel of Van Rycke's cabin, his\r\n",
      "eyes glued to the thin crack of the door. Dane scooped him up and took\r\n",
      "him to the small cargo space intended for the safeguarding of choice\r\n",
      "items of commerce. To his vast surprise Sinbad began fighting wildly as\r\n",
      "he opened the hatch, kicking and then slashing with ready claws. The cat\r\n",
      "seemed to go mad and Dane had all he could do to shut him in. When he\r\n",
      "snapped the panel he heard Sinbad launch himself against the barrier as\r\n",
      "if to batter his way out. Dane, blood welling in several deep scratches,\r\n",
      "went in search of first aid. But some suspicion led him to pause as he\r\n",
      "passed Van Rycke's door. And when his knock brought no answer he pushed\r\n",
      "the panel open.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Van Rycke lay on his bunk, his eyes half closed in a way which had become\r\n",
      "only too familiar to the crew of the Solar Queen. And Dane knew that when\r\n",

      "that it might be up to him to bring the Queen in for a landing. And in\r\n",

      "\"Old Man's got it,\" he reported.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Rip?\" was Ali's crossing question.\r\n",

      "\"Asleep. He passed out--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What!\" Weeks swung around.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Worn out,\" Dane amended. \"Captain fed in a pilot tape before he gave\r\n",
      "up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"If they let us,\" Dane hinted at the worst.\r\n",

      "around out here--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's been done,\" Ali reminded them brutally and that silenced Weeks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Did the Old Man set Luna?\" After a long pause Ali inquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I didn't check,\" Dane confessed. \"He was giving out and I had to get him\r\n",
      "to his bunk.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It might be well to know.\" The Engineer-apprentice got up, his movements\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Ali's slender fingers played across a set of keys and in the small screen\r\n",

      "master course book, read the connotation and blinked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not Luna?\" Ali asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No. But I don't understand. This must be for somewhere in the asteroid\r\n",
      "belt.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ali's lips stretched into a pale caricature of a smile. \"Good for the Old\r\n",
      "Man, he still had his wits about him, even after the bug bit him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But why are we going to the asteroids?\" Weeks asked reasonably enough.\r\n",
      "\"There're Medics at Luna City--they can help us--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They can handle known diseases,\" Ali pointed out. \"But what of the\r\n",
      "Code?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Weeks dropped into the Com-tech's place as if some of the stiffening had\r\n",
      "vanished from his thin but sturdy legs. \"They wouldn't do that--\" he\r\n",
      "protested, but his eyes said that he knew that they might--they well\r\n",
      "might.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, no? Face the facts, man,\" Ali sounded almost savage. \"We come from a\r\n",
      "frontier planet, we're a plague ship--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did not have to underline that. They all knew too well the danger in\r\n",
      "which they now stood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nobody's died yet,\" Weeks tried to find an opening in the net being\r\n",
      "drawn about them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And nobody's recovered,\" Ali crushed that thread of hope. \"We don't know\r\n",
      "what it is, how it is contracted--anything about it. Let us make a report\r\n",
      "saying that and you know what will happen--don't you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They weren't sure of the details, but they could guess.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So I say,\" Ali continued, \"the Old Man was right when he set us on an\r\n",
      "evasion course. If we can stay out until we really know what is the\r\n",
      "matter we'll have some chance of talking over the high brass at Luna when\r\n",
      "we do planet--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the end they decided not to interfere with the course the Captain had\r\n",
      "set. It would take them into the fringes of solar civilization, but give\r\n",
      "them a fighting chance at solving their problem before they had to report\r\n",
      "to the authorities. In the meantime they tended their charges, let Rip\r\n",
      "sleep, and watched each other with desperate but hidden intentness, ready\r\n",
      "for another to be stricken. However, they remained, although almost\r\n",
      "stupid with fatigue at times, reasonably healthy. Time was proving that\r\n",
      "their guess had been correct--they had been somehow inoculated against\r\n",
      "the germ or virus which had struck the ship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rip slept for twenty-four hours, ship time, and then came into the mess\r\n",
      "cabin ravenously hungry, to catch up on both food and news. And he\r\n",
      "refused to join with the prevailing pessimistic view of the future.\r\n",
      "Instead he was sure that their own immunity having been proven, they had\r\n",
      "a talking point to use with the medical officials at Luna and he was\r\n",
      "eager to alter course directly for the quarantine station. Only the\r\n",
      "combined arguments of the other three made him, unwillingly, agree to a\r\n",
      "short delay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And how grateful they should be for Captain Jellico's foresight they\r\n",
      "learned within the next day. Ali was at the com-unit, trying to pick up\r\n",
      "Solarian news reports. When the red alert flashed on throughout the ship\r\n",
      "it brought the others hurrying to the control cabin. The code squeaks\r\n",
      "were magnified as Ali switched on the receiver full strength, to be\r\n",
      "translated as he pressed a second button.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Repeat, repeat, repeat. Free Trader, Solar Queen, Terra Registry\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "dirt-side there about three-four months. Yet they gave it a clean bill of\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "mixture of greens from the familiar shade of Terra's fields to greens\r\n",
      "tinged with shades first bestowed by other suns on other worlds--looking\r\n",
      "for one which was alien enough to be noticeable. Only Mura, who knew\r\n",
      "this garden as he knew his own cabin, could have differentiated between\r\n",
      "them. They would just dump everything and trust to luck--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was suddenly aware of a slight movement in the banks--a shivering of\r\n",

      "plant to register his presence. A lacy, fern-like thing was contracting\r\n",
      "its fronds into balls. He should not stay--disturbing the peace of the\r\n",
      "hydro. But it made little difference now--within a matter of hours all\r\n",
      "this luxuriance would be thrust out to die and they would have to depend\r\n",
      "upon canned oxgy and algae tanks. Too bad--the hydro represented much\r\n",

      "had marked his passage, he heard a faint rustling, a sound as if a wind\r\n",
      "had swept across the green room within. The imagination which was a\r\n",
      "Trader's asset (when it was kept within bounds) suggested that the plants\r\n",

      "of the past few days with an ear-splitting screech of fury. Dane struck\r\n",
      "at the bottom of its cage--the move its master always used to silence\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The cage bounced up and down on the spring which secured it to the\r\n",
      "ceiling of the cabin and the blue feathered horror slammed against the\r\n",
      "wires. Either its clawing had weakened them, or some fault had developed,\r\n",
      "for they parted and the Hoobat came through them to land with a sullen\r\n",
      "plop on the desk. Its screams stopped as suddenly as they had begun and\r\n",
      "it scuttled on its spider-toad legs to the microtape compartment, acting\r\n",
      "with purposeful dispatch and paying no attention to Dane.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Its claws shot out and with ease it extracted from the compartment a\r\n",
      "creature as weird as itself--one which came fighting and of which Dane\r\n",
      "could not get a very clear idea. Struggling they battled across the\r\n",
      "surface of the desk and flopped to the floor. There the hunted broke\r\n",
      "loose from the hunter and fled with fantastic speed into the corridor.\r\n",
      "And before Dane could move the Hoobat was after it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gained the passage just in time to see Queex disappear down the\r\n",
      "ladder, clinging with the aid of its pincher claws, apparently grimly\r\n",
      "determined to catch up with the thing it pursued. And Dane went after\r\n",
      "them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no sign of the creature who fled on the next level. But Dane\r\n",
      "made no move to recapture the blue hunter who squatted at the foot of the\r\n",
      "ladder staring unblinkingly into space. Dane waited, afraid to disturb\r\n",
      "the Hoobat. He had not had a good look at the thing which had run from\r\n",
      "Queex--but he knew it was something which had no business aboard the\r\n",
      "Queen. And it might be the disturbing factor they were searching for. If\r\n",
      "the Hoobat would only lead him to it--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Hoobat moved, rearing up on the tips of its six legs, its neckless\r\n",
      "head slowly revolving on its puffy shoulders. Along the ridge of its\r\n",
      "backbone its blue feathers were rising into a crest much as Sinbad's fur\r\n",
      "rose when the cat was afraid or angry. Then, without any sign of haste,\r\n",
      "it crawled over and began descending the ladder once more, heading toward\r\n",
      "the lower section which housed the Hydro.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane remained where he was until it had almost reached the deck of the\r\n",
      "next level and then he followed, one step at a time. He was sure that the\r\n",
      "Hoobat's peculiar construction of body prevented it from looking\r\n",
      "up--unless it turned upon its back--but he did not want to do anything\r\n",
      "which would alarm it or deter Queex from what he was sure was a\r\n",
      "methodical chase.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Queex stopped again at the foot of the second descent and sat in its toad\r\n",
      "stance, apparently brooding, a round blue blot. Dane clung to the ladder\r\n",
      "and prayed that no one would happen along to frighten it. Then, just as\r\n",
      "he was beginning to wonder if it had lost contact with its prey, once\r\n",
      "more it arose and with the same speed it had displayed in the Captain's\r\n",
      "cabin it shot along the corridor to the hydro.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To Dane's knowledge the door of the garden was not only shut but sealed.\r\n",
      "And how either the stranger or Queex could get through it he did not see.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What the--?\" Ali clattered down the ladder to halt abruptly as Dane waved\r\n",
      "at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Queex,\" the Cargo-apprentice kept his voice to a half whisper, \"it got\r\n",
      "loose and chased something out of the Old Man's cabin down here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Queex--!\" Ali began and then shut his mouth, moving noiselessly up to\r\n",
      "join Dane.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The short corridor ended at the hydro entrance. And Dane had been right,\r\n",
      "there they found the Hoobat, crouched at the closed panel, its claws\r\n",
      "clicking against the metal as it picked away useless at the portal which\r\n",
      "would not admit it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Whatever it's after must be in there,\" Dane said softly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And the hydro, stripped of its luxuriance of plant life, occupied now by\r\n",
      "the tanks of green scum, would not afford too many hiding places. They\r\n",
      "had only to let Queex in and keep watch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As they came up the Hoobat flattened to the floor and shrilled its war\r\n",
      "cry, spitting at their boots and then flashing claws against the stout\r\n",
      "metal enforced hide. However, though it was prepared to fight them, it\r\n",
      "showed no signs of wishing to retreat, and for that Dane was thankful. He\r\n",
      "quickly pressed the release and tugged open the panel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the first crack of its opening Queex turned with one of those bursts\r\n",
      "of astounding speed and clawed for admittance, its protest against the\r\n",
      "men forgotten. And it squeezed through a space Dane would have thought\r\n",
      "too narrow to accommodate its bloated body. Both men slipped around the\r\n",
      "door behind it and closed the panel tight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The air was not as fresh as it had been when the plants were there. And\r\n",
      "the vats which had taken the places of the banked greenery were certainly\r\n",
      "nothing to look at. Queex humped itself into a clod of blue, immovable,\r\n",
      "halfway down the aisle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane tried to subdue his breathing, to listen. The Hoobat's actions\r\n",
      "certainly argued that the alien thing had taken refuge here, though how\r\n",
      "it had gotten through--? But if it were in the hydro it was well hidden.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had just begun to wonder how long they must wait when Queex again went\r\n",
      "into action. Its clawed front legs upraised, it brought the pinchers\r\n",
      "deliberately together and sawed one across the other, producing a rasping\r\n",
      "sound which was almost a vibration in the air. Back and forth, back and\r\n",
      "forth, moved the claws. Watching them produced almost a hypnotic effect,\r\n",
      "and the reason for such a maneuver was totally beyond the human watchers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Queex knew what it was doing all right, Ali's fingers closed on\r\n",
      "Dane's arm in a pincher grip as painful as if he had been equipped with\r\n",
      "the horny armament of the Hoobat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Something, a flitting shadow, had rounded one vat and was that much\r\n",
      "closer to the industrious fiddler on the floor. By some weird magic of\r\n",
      "its own the Hoobat was calling its prey to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Scrape, scrape--the unmusical performance continued with monotonous\r\n",
      "regularity. Again the shadow flashed--one vat closer. The Hoobat now\r\n",
      "presented the appearance of one charmed by its own art--sunk in a\r\n",
      "lethargy of weird music making.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last the enchanted came into full view, though lingering at the round\r\n",
      "side of a container, very apparently longing to flee again, but under\r\n",
      "some compulsion to approach its enchanter. Dane blinked, not quite sure\r\n",
      "that his eyes were not playing tricks on him. He had seen the almost\r\n",
      "transparent globe \"bogies\" of Limbo, had been fascinated by the weird and\r\n",
      "ugly pictures in Captain Jellico's collection of tri-dee prints. But this\r\n",
      "creature was as impossible in its way as the horrific blue thing dragging\r\n",
      "it out of concealment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It walked erect on two threads of legs, with four knobby joints easily\r\n",
      "detected. A bulging abdomen sheathed in the horny substance of a beetle's\r\n",
      "shell ended in a sharp point. Two pairs of small legs, folded close to\r\n",
      "the much smaller upper portion of its body, were equipped with thorn\r\n",
      "shack terminations. The head, which constantly turned back and forth on\r\n",
      "the armor plated shoulders, was long and narrow and split for half its\r\n",
      "length by a mouth above which were deep pits which must harbor eyes,\r\n",
      "though actual organs were not visible to the watching men. It was a\r\n",
      "palish gray in color--which surprised Dane a little. His memory of the\r\n",
      "few seconds he had seen it on the Captain's desk had suggested that it\r\n",
      "was much darker. And erect as it was, it stood about eighteen inches\r\n",
      "high.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With head turning rapidly, it still hesitated by the side of the vat, so\r\n",
      "nearly the color of the metal that unless it moved it was difficult to\r\n",
      "distinguish. As far as Dane could see the Hoobat was paying it no\r\n",
      "attention. Queex might be lost in a happy dream, the result of its own\r\n",
      "fiddling. Nor did the rhythm of that scraping vary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The nightmare thing made the last foot in a rush of speed which reduced\r\n",
      "it to a blur, coming to a halt before the Hoobat. Its front legs whipped\r\n",
      "out to strike at its enemy. But Queex was no longer dreaming. This was\r\n",
      "the moment the Hoobat had been awaiting. One of the sawing claws opened\r\n",
      "and closed, separating the head of the lurker from its body. And before\r\n",
      "either of the men could interfere Queex had dismembered the prey with\r\n",
      "dispatch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Look there!\" Dane pointed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Hoobat held close the body of the stranger and where the ashy corpse\r\n",
      "came into contact with Queex's blue feathered skin it was slowly changing\r\n",
      "hue--as if some of the color of its hunter had rubbed off it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Chameleon!\" Ali went down on one knee the better to view the grisly\r\n",
      "feast now in progress. \"Watch out!\" he added sharply as Dane came to join\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the thin upper limbs lay where Queex had discarded it. And from\r\n",
      "the needle tip was oozing some colorless drops of fluid. Poison?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane looked around for something which he could use to pick up the still\r\n",
      "jerking appendage. But before he could find anything Queex had\r\n",
      "appropriated it. And in the end they had to allow the Hoobat its victim\r\n",
      "in its entirety. But once Queex had consumed its prey it lapsed into its\r\n",
      "usual hunched immobility. Dane went for the cage and working gingerly he\r\n",
      "and Ali got the creature back in captivity. But all the evidence now left\r\n",
      "were some smears on the floor of the hydro, smears which Ali blotted up\r\n",
      "for future research in the lab.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An hour later the four who now comprised the crew of the Queen gathered\r\n",
      "in the mess for a conference. Queex was in its cage on the table before\r\n",
      "them, asleep after all its untoward activity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There must be more than just one,\" Weeks said. \"But how are we going to\r\n",

      "prominent evidence of the battle scraped from the floor, he had brought\r\n",
      "the cat into the hydro and forced him to sniff at the site of the\r\n",
      "engagement. The result was that Sinbad had gone raving mad and Dane's\r\n",
      "hands were now covered with claw tears which ran viciously deep. It was\r\n",
      "plain that the ship's cat was having none of the intruders, alive or\r\n",
      "dead. He had fled to Dane's cabin where he had taken refuge on the bunk\r\n",
      "and snarled wild eyed when anyone looked in from the corridor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Queex has to do it,\" Rip said. \"But will it hunt unless it is hungry?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He surveyed the now comatose creature skeptically. They had never seen\r\n",
      "the Captain's pet eat anything except some pellets which Jellico kept in\r\n",
      "his desk, and they were aware that the intervals between such feedings\r\n",
      "were quite lengthy. If they had to wait the usual time for Queex to feel\r\n",
      "hunger pangs once more, they might have to wait a long time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We should catch one alive,\" Ali remarked thoughtfully. \"If we could get\r\n",
      "Queex to fiddle it out to where we could net it--\"\r\n",

      "over the thing--\"\r\n",

      "Holding the color changing abilities of the enemy in mind they could not\r\n",
      "tell how many of the creatures might be roaming the ship. It could only\r\n",
      "be proved where they weren't by where Sinbad would consent to stay. So\r\n",
      "they made plans which included both the cat and the Hoobat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sinbad, much against his will, was buckled into an improvised harness by\r\n",
      "which he could be controlled without the handler losing too much valuable\r\n",
      "skin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then the hunt started at the top of the ship, proceeding downward\r\n",
      "section by section. Sinbad raised no protest in the control cabin, nor in\r\n",
      "the private cabins of the officers' thereabouts. If they could interpret\r\n",
      "his reactions the center section was free of the invaders. So with Dane\r\n",
      "in control of the cat and Ali carrying the caged Hoobat, they descended\r\n",
      "once more to the level which housed the hydro galley, steward's quarters\r\n",
      "and ship's sick bay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sinbad proceeded on his own four feet into the galley and the mess. He\r\n",
      "was not uneasy in the sick bay, nor in Mura's cabin, and this time he\r\n",
      "even paced the hydro without being dragged--much to their surprise as\r\n",
      "they had thought that the headquarters of the stowaways.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Could there only have been one?\" Weeks wanted to know as he stood by\r\n",
      "ready with the net in his hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Either that--or else we're wrong about the hydro being their main\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was when they were on the ladder leading to the cargo level that\r\n",

      "raising itself, leaning forward to clasp the bars of its cage, and now it\r\n",
      "uttered one of its screams of rage. And as Ali went on down the ladder it\r\n",
      "rattled the bars in a determined effort for freedom. Sinbad, spitting and\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The things were ringing in the pile of wood where the Hoobat fiddled, and\r\n",
      "two had ascended the first logs toward their doom. Weeks went down on one\r\n",
      "knee, ready to cast his net, when Dane had his first inspiration. He drew\r\n",

      "beamed it at three of those humps.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "the oiler in check. A hump moved, slid down the rounded side of the log\r\n",
      "into the narrow aisle of deck between two piles of wood. It lay quiet, a\r\n",
      "bright scarlet blot against the gray.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Weeks did move, throwing his net over it and jerking the draw string\r\n",
      "tight, at the same time pulling the captive toward him over the deck.\r\n",
      "But, even as it came, the scarlet of the thing's body was fast fading to\r\n",
      "an ashy pink and at last taking on a gray as dull as the metal on which\r\n",
      "it lay--the complete camouflage. Had they not had it enmeshed they might\r\n",

      "Weeks passed Sinbad on his errand, the cat was so frantic to avoid him,\r\n",
      "that he reared up on his hind legs, almost turning a somersault, snarling\r\n",
      "and spitting until Weeks was up the ladder to the next level. It was\r\n",
      "very evident that the ship's cat was having none of this pest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They might have been invisible and their actions non-existent as far as\r\n",
      "Queex was concerned. For the Hoobat continued its siren concert. The\r\n",
      "lured became more reckless, mounting the logs to Queex's post in sudden\r\n",
      "darts. Dane wondered how the Hoobat proposed handling four of the\r\n",
      "creatures at once. For, although the other two which had been in the path\r\n",
      "of the ray had not moved, he now counted four climbing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stand by to ray--\" that was Rip.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "not ordered the ray to be used. Was he, too, interested in that?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first red projection was within a foot of the Hoobat now and its\r\n",
      "fellows had frozen as if to allow it the honor of battle with the\r\n",
      "feathered enemy. To all appearances Queex did not see it, but when it\r\n",
      "sprang with a whir of speed which would baffle a human, the Hoobat was\r\n",
      "ready and its claws, halting their rasp, met around the wasp-thin waist\r\n",
      "of the pest, speedily cutting it in two. Only this time the Hoobat made\r\n",
      "no move to unjoint and consume the victim. Instead it squatted in utter\r\n",
      "silence, as motionless as a tri-dee print.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The heavy lower half of the creature rolled down the pile of logs to the\r\n",
      "deck and there paled to the gray of its background. None of its kind\r\n",
      "appeared to be interested in its fate. The two which had been in the path\r\n",
      "of the ray, continued to be humps on the wood, the others faced the\r\n",
      "Hoobat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Rip was ready to waste no more time. \"Ray them!\" he snapped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All three of their sleep rods sprayed the pile, catching in passing the\r\n",
      "Hoobat. Queex's pop eyes closed, but it showed no other sign of falling\r\n",
      "under the spell of the beam.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Certain that all the creatures in sight were now relatively harmless, the\r\n",
      "three approached the logs. But it was necessary to get into touching\r\n",
      "distance before they could even make out the outlines of the nightmare\r\n",
      "things, so well did their protective coloring conceal them. Wearing\r\n",
      "gloves Ali detached the little monsters from their holds on the wood and\r\n",
      "put them for temporary safekeeping--during a transfer to the deep\r\n",
      "freeze--into the Hoobat's cage. Queex, they decided to leave where it was\r\n",
      "for a space, to awaken and trap any survivor which had been too wary to\r\n",
      "emerge at the first siren song. As far as they could tell the Hoobat was\r\n",
      "their only possible protection against the pest and to leave it in the\r\n",
      "center of infection was the wisest course.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "conference.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No plague--\" Weeks breathed a sigh of relief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"And how are we going to do--?\" Dane began when he saw what the other had\r\n",
      "brought in from Tau's stores. A lancet and the upper half of the creature\r\n",
      "Queex had killed in the cargo hold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The needle pointed front feet of the thing were curled up in its death\r\n",
      "throes and it was now a dirty white shade as if the ability to change\r\n",
      "color had been lost before it matched the cotton on which it lay. With\r\n",
      "the lancet Ali forced a claw away from the body. It was oozing the watery\r\n",
      "liquid which they had seen on the one in the hydro.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have an idea,\" he said slowly, his eyes on the mangled creature rather\r\n",
      "than on his shipmates, \"that we might have escaped being attacked because\r\n",
      "they sheered off from us. But if we were clawed we might take it too.\r\n",
      "Remember those marks on the throats and backs of the rest? That might be\r\n",
      "the entry point of this poison--if poison it is--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane could see the end of that line of reasoning. Rip and Ali--they\r\n",
      "couldn't be spared. The knowledge they had would bring the Queen to\r\n",
      "earth. But a Cargo-master was excess baggage when there was no reason for\r\n",
      "trade. It was his place to try out the truth of Ali's surmise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But while he thought another acted. Weeks leaned over and twitched the\r\n",
      "lancet out of Ali's fingers. Then, before any of them could move, he\r\n",
      "thrust its contaminated point into the back of his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both Dane's cry and Rip's hand came too late. It had been done. And Weeks\r\n",
      "sat there, looking alone and frightened, studying the drop of blood which\r\n",
      "marked the dig of the surgeon's keen knife. But when he spoke his voice\r\n",
      "sounded perfectly natural.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Headache first, isn't it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Only Ali was outwardly unaffected by what the little man had just done.\r\n",
      "\"Just be sure you have a real one,\" he warned with what Dane privately\r\n",
      "considered real callousness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Weeks nodded. \"Don't let my imagination work,\" he answered shrewdly. \"I\r\n",
      "know. It has to be real. How long do you suppose?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We don't know,\" Rip sounded tired, beaten. \"Meanwhile,\" he got to his\r\n",
      "feet, \"we'd better set a course home--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Home,\" Weeks repeated. To him Terra was not his own home--he had been\r\n",
      "born in the polar swamps of Venus. But to All Solarians--no matter which\r\n",
      "planet had nurtured them--Terra was home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You,\" Rip's big hand fell gently on the little oiler's shoulder, \"stay\r\n",
      "here with Thorson--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" Weeks shook his head. \"Unless I black out, I'm riding station in\r\n",
      "the engine room. Maybe the bug won't work on me anyway.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And because he had done what he had done they could not deny him the\r\n",
      "right to ride his station as long as he could during the grueling hours\r\n",
      "to come.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane visited the cargo hold once more. To be greeted by an irate scream\r\n",
      "which assured him that Queex was again awake and on guard. Although the\r\n",
      "Hoobat was ready enough to give tongue, it still squatted in its chosen\r\n",
      "position on top of the log stack and he did not try to dislodge it.\r\n",
      "Perhaps with Queex planted in the enemies' territory they would have\r\n",
      "nothing to fear from any pests not now confined in the deep freeze.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rip set his course for Terra--for that plague spot on their native world\r\n",
      "where they might hide out the Queen until they could prove their\r\n",
      "point--that the spacer was not a disease ridden ship to be feared. He\r\n",
      "kept to the control cabin, shifting only between the Astrogator's and the\r\n",
      "pilot's station. Upon him alone rested the responsibility of bringing in\r\n",
      "the ship along a vector which crossed no well traveled space lane where\r\n",
      "the Patrol might challenge them. Dane rode out the orbiting in the\r\n",
      "Com-tech's seat, listening in for the first warning of danger--that they\r\n",
      "had been detected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The mechanical repetition of their list of crimes was now stale news and\r\n",
      "largely off-ether. And from all traces he could pick up, they were lost\r\n",
      "as far as the authorities were concerned. On the other hand, the Patrol\r\n",
      "might indeed be as far knowing as its propaganda stated and the Queen was\r\n",
      "running headlong into a trap. Only they had no choice in the matter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the ship's inter-com bringing Ali's voice from the engine room\r\n",
      "which broke the concentration in the control cabin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Weeks' down!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "How long they sweated out that descent upon their native world Dane could\r\n",
      "never afterwards have testified. He only knew that hours must have\r\n",

      "Far from being in the center--or at least well within the perimeter of\r\n",

      "uncontaminated earth with honest vegetation--in place of the \"hot\" jungle\r\n",
      "now miles behind. That night he camped out on the edge of rough pasturage\r\n",
      "where the counter no longer flashed its warning and he was able to shed\r\n",
      "the suit and sleep under the stars with the fresh air of early summer\r\n",

      "almost be Tau's elder brother. He crossed the room with a brisk stride\r\n",
      "and came to stand over Dane, his hand reaching to pull aside the bloody\r\n",

      "before this outrage was reported to the nearest Plant Police base. But\r\n",

      "devastated area. The metal encased figure that shared his seat had not\r\n",
      "moved, but now the bubble head turned as if the Medic were intent upon\r\n",
      "the ground flowing beneath them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The flicker of the counter began and Dane realized that nightfall would\r\n",

      "vines, brush, had a pale, evil glow of their own, proclaiming their\r\n",
      "toxicity with bluish halos. Sometimes pockets of these made a core of\r\n",

      "different purpose. The Queen had earthed with her distress lights on and\r\n",

      "which was partly relief from tension, sought his cabin and the bunk from\r\n",

      "hope to return to Sargol with the promised cargo, the pay for which was\r\n",
      "already on board the Queen. They would have broken their pledge and there\r\n",
      "could be no hope of holding to their trading rights on that world--if\r\n",
      "they were not blacklisted for breaking contract into the bargain. I-S\r\n",

      "of that incandescent circle on the door some twenty floors below stayed\r\n",
      "with him. Tempers of Police and Patrol were not going to be improved by\r\n",
      "fighting their way around or over the obstacles the Traders had arranged\r\n",

      "the half-recumbent figure, did things to his sight and to his sense of\r\n",
      "balance which seemed perilous in the extreme. But when the groan broke\r\n",
      "through the hum of Ali's mysterious machine, all of them knew that the\r\n",

      "waking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Already his mouth was dry and his nerves tense. But Dane didn't know that\r\n",
      "none of that was revealed by his face or manner. The usual impassiveness\r\n",
      "which had masked his inner conflicts since his first days at the Pool\r\n",
      "served him now. And the others never noted the hesitation with which he\r\n",
      "approached the announcer's place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane had scarcely seated himself, one hand resting on the cage of the\r\n",
      "pest, before Ali brought down two fingers in the sharp sweep which\r\n",
      "signaled the Com-tech to duty. Far above them there was a whisper of\r\n",
      "sound which signified the opening of the play-back. They would be able to\r\n",
      "check on whether the broadcast was going out or not. Although Dane could\r\n",
      "see nothing of the system wide audience which he currently faced, he\r\n",
      "realized that the room and those in it were now visible on every tuned-in\r\n",
      "video set. Instead of the factual cast, the listeners were about to be\r\n",
      "treated to a melodrama which was as wild as their favorite romances. It\r\n",

      "action-fiction--crime variety.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A second finger moved in his direction and Dane leaned forward. He faced\r\n",

      "truth there was a sea of faces before him, the faces of those whom he and\r\n",
      "Hovan, working together, must convince if he were to save the Queen and\r\n",
      "her crew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He found his voice and it was steady and even, he might have been\r\n",

      "\"People of Terra--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "outlawed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Swiftly, with a flow of language he had not known he could command, Dane\r\n",
      "swung into the story of Sargol, of the pest they had carried away from\r\n",
      "that world. And at the proper moment he thrust a gloved hand into the\r\n",
      "cage and brought out the wriggling thing which struck vainly with its\r\n",
      "poisoned talons, holding it above the dark table so that those unseen\r\n",
      "watchers could witness the dramatic change of color which made it such a\r\n",
      "menace. Dane continued the story of the Queen's ill-fated voyage--of\r\n",
      "their forced descent upon the E-Stat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ask the truth of Inter-Solar,\" he demanded of the audience beyond those\r\n",
      "walls. \"We were no pirates. They will discover in their records the\r\n",
      "vouchers we left.\" Then Dane described the weird hunt when, led by the\r\n",
      "Hoobat, they had finally found and isolated the menace, and their landing\r\n",
      "in the heart of the Big Burn. He followed that with his own quest for\r\n",
      "medical aid, the kidnapping of Hovan. At that point he turned to the\r\n",
      "Medic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This is Medic Hovan. He has consented to appear in our behalf and to\r\n",
      "testify to the truth--that the Solar Queen has not been stricken by some\r\n",
      "unknown plague, but infested with a living organism we now have under\r\n",
      "control--\" For a suspenseful second or two he wondered if Hovan was going\r\n",
      "to make it. The man looked shaken and sick, as if the drastic awaking\r\n",
      "they had subjected him to had left him too dazed to pull himself\r\n",
      "together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But out of some hidden reservoir of strength the Medic summoned the\r\n",
      "energy he needed. And his testimony was all they had hoped it would be.\r\n",
      "Though now and then he strayed into technical terms. But, Dane thought,\r\n",
      "their use only enhanced the authority of his description of what he had\r\n",
      "discovered on board the spacer and what he had done to counteract the\r\n",
      "power of the poison. When he had done Dane added a few last words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We have broken the law,\" he admitted forthrightly, \"but we were fighting\r\n",
      "in self-defense. All we ask now is the privilege of an impartial\r\n",
      "investigation, a chance to defend ourselves--such as any of you take for\r\n",
      "granted on Terra--before the courts of this planet--\" But he was not to\r\n",
      "finish without interruption.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From the play-back over their heads another voice blared, breaking across\r\n",
      "his last words:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Surrender! This is the Patrol. Surrender or take the consequences!\" And\r\n",
      "that faint sighing which signaled their open contact with the outer world\r\n",
      "was cut off. The Com-tech turned away from the control board, a sneering\r\n",
      "half smile on his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They've reached the circuit and cut you off. You're done!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane stared into the cage where the now almost invisible thing sat humped\r\n",
      "together. He had done his best--they had all done their best. He felt\r\n",
      "nothing but a vast fatigue, an overwhelming weariness, not so much of\r\n",
      "body, but of nerve and spirit too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Rip stood up. He unbuckled the belt about his waist and laid it on the\r\n",
      "table--disarming himself. Without words Ali and Dane followed his\r\n",
      "example. They had played their hand--to prolong the struggle would mean\r\n",
      "nothing. The acting Captain of the Queen gave a last order:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Tell them we are coming down unarmed--to surrender.\" He paused in front\r\n",
      "of Hovan. \"You'd better stay here. If there's any trouble--no reason for\r\n",
      "you to be caught in the middle.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"We may be marooned here--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ali shrugged. \"Then we can just wait and let them collect us.\" He yawned,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Rip neither denied nor confirmed. \"We took our only chance. Now it's up\r\n",

      "it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ali grinned wryly. \"I note you left the what-you-call-it with Hovan.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"And now here comes what we've earned--\" Rip cut in as the hum of the\r\n",
      "riser came to their ears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Should we take to cover?\" Ali's mobile eyebrows underlined his demand.\r\n",
      "\"The forces of law and order may erupt with blasters blazing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Rip did not move. He faced the riser door squarely and, drawn by\r\n",
      "something in that stance of his, the other two stepped in on either side\r\n",
      "so that they fronted the dubious future as a united group. Whatever came\r\n",
      "now, the Queen's men would meet it together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a way Ali was right. The four men who emerged all had their blasters\r\n",
      "or riot stun-rifles at ready, and the sights of those weapons were\r\n",
      "trained at the middles of the Free Traders. As Dane's empty hands, palm\r\n",
      "out, went up on a line with his shoulders, he estimated the opposition.\r\n",
      "Two were in the silver and black of the Patrol, two wore the forest green\r\n",
      "of the Terrapolice. But they all looked like men with whom it was better\r\n",
      "not to play games.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And it was clear they were prepared to take no chances with the outlaws.\r\n",
      "In spite of the passiveness of the Queen's men, their hands were locked\r\n",
      "behind them with force bars about their wrists. When a quick search\r\n",
      "revealed that the three were unarmed, they were herded onto the riser by\r\n",
      "two of their captors, while the other pair remained behind, presumably to\r\n",
      "uncover any damage they had done to the Tower installations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The police did not speak except for a few terse words among themselves\r\n",
      "and a barked order to march, delivered to the prisoners. Very shortly\r\n",
      "they were in the entrance hall facing the wreckage of the crawler and\r\n",
      "doors through which a ragged gap had been burned. Ali viewed the scene\r\n",
      "with his usual detachment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nice job,\" he commended Dane's enterprise. \"They'll have a moving--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Get going!\" A heavy hand between his shoulder blades urged him on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Engineer-apprentice whirled, his eyes blazing. \"Keep your hands to\r\n",
      "yourself! We aren't mine fodder yet. I think that the little matter of a\r\n",
      "trial comes first--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're Posted,\" the Patrolman was openly contemptuous.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane was chilled. For the first time that aspect of their predicament\r\n",
      "really registered. Posted outlaws might, within reason, be shot on sight\r\n",
      "without further recourse to the law. If that label stuck on the crew of\r\n",
      "the Queen, they had practically no chance at all. And when he saw that\r\n",
      "Ali was no longer inclined to retort, he knew that fact had dawned upon\r\n",
      "Kamil also. It would all depend upon how big an impression their\r\n",
      "broadcast had made. If public opinion veered to their side--then they\r\n",
      "could defend themselves legally. Otherwise the moon mines might be the\r\n",
      "best sentence they dare hope for.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were pushed out into the brilliant sunlight. There stood the Queen,\r\n",
      "her meteor scarred side reflecting the light of her native sun. And\r\n",
      "ringed around her at a safe distance was what seemed to be a small\r\n",
      "mechanized army corps. The authorities were making very sure that no more\r\n",
      "rebels would burst from her interior.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane thought that they would be loaded into a mobile or 'copter and taken\r\n",
      "away. But instead they were marched down, through the ranks of portable\r\n",
      "flamers, scramblers, and other equipment, to an open space where anyone\r\n",
      "on duty at the visa-screen within the control cabin of the spacer could\r\n",
      "see them. An officer of the Patrol, the sun making an eye-blinding flash\r\n",
      "of his lightning sword breast badge, stood behind a loud speaker. When\r\n",
      "he perceived that the three prisoners were present, he picked up a hand\r\n",
      "mike and spoke into it--his voice so being relayed over the field as\r\n",
      "clearly as it must be reaching Weeks inside the sealed freighter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You have five minutes to open hatch. Your men have been taken. Five\r\n",
      "minutes to open hatch and surrender.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ali chuckled. \"And how does he think he's going to enforce that?\" he\r\n",
      "inquired of the air and incidentally of the guards now forming a square\r\n",
      "about the three. \"He'll need more than a flamer to unlatch the old girl\r\n",
      "if she doesn't care for his offer.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Privately Dane agreed with that. He hoped that Weeks would decide to hold\r\n",
      "out--at least until they had a better idea of what the future would be.\r\n",
      "No tool or weapon he saw in the assembly about them was forceful enough\r\n",
      "to penetrate the shell of the Queen. And there were sufficient supplies\r\n",
      "on board to keep Weeks and his charges going for at least a week. Since\r\n",

      "\"If and when they surrender they shall all be accorded necessary aid,\"\r\n",

      "\"For the Public Good--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A plague ship--\" the officer was beginning. Hovan waved that aside\r\n",
      "impatiently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nonsense!\" His voice scaled up across the field. \"There is no plague\r\n",

      "refuse these men medical attention--which they need--I shall cite the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "one of the Queen's crew, in fact having good reason to be angry over his\r\n",
      "treatment at their hands, Hovan's present attitude would or should carry\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The Patrol officer who was not yet ready to concede all points had an\r\n",
      "answer: \"If you are able to get on board--go.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "All eyes were on the ship and for a short period it would seem that Weeks\r\n",
      "did not trust the Medic. Then, high in her needle nose, one of the escape\r\n",
      "ports, not intended for use except in dire emergency opened and allowed a\r\n",
      "plastic link ladder to fall link by link.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Out of the corner of his eye Dane caught a flash of movement to his left.\r\n",
      "Manacled as he was he threw himself on the policeman who was aiming a\r\n",
      "stun rifle into the port. His shoulder struck the fellow waist high and\r\n",
      "his weight carried them both with a bruising crash to the concrete\r\n",

      "Cargo-apprentice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was pulled to his feet, tasting the flat sweetness of blood where a\r\n",
      "flailing blow from the surprised and frightened policeman had cut his lip\r\n",
      "against his teeth. He spat red and glowered at the ring of angry men.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "out of his hold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your boy here,\" Ali was ready with an answer, \"tried to find a target\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He was answered by a glare and the rifleman was abruptly ordered to the\r\n",
      "rear. Dane, his head clearing, looked at the Queen. Hovan was climbing\r\n",
      "the ladder--he was within arm's length of that half open hatch. The very\r\n",
      "fact that the Medic had managed to make his point stick was, in a faint\r\n",
      "way, encouraging. But the three were not allowed to enjoy that small\r\n",
      "victory for long. They were marched from the field, loaded into a mobile\r\n",
      "and taken to the city several miles away. It was the Patrol who held them\r\n",
      "in custody--not the Terrapolice. Dane was not sure whether that was to be\r\n",
      "reckoned favorable or not. As a Free Trader he had a grudging respect for\r\n",
      "the organization he had seen in action on Limbo.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sometime later they found themselves, freed of the force bars, alone in a\r\n",
      "room which, bare walled as it was, did have a bench on which all three\r\n",
      "sank thankfully. Dane caught the warning gesture from Ali--they were\r\n",
      "under unseen observation and they must have a listening audience\r\n",
      "too--located somewhere in the maze of offices.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They can't make up their minds,\" the Engineer-apprentice settled his\r\n",
      "shoulders against the wall. \"Either we're desperate criminals, or we're\r\n",
      "heroes. They're going to let time decide.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If we're heroes,\" Dane asked a little querulously, \"what are we doing\r\n",
      "locked up here? I'd like a few earth-side comforts--beginning with a full\r\n",
      "meal--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No thumb printing, no psycho testing,\" Rip mused. \"Yes, they haven't put\r\n",
      "us through the system yet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And we decidedly aren't the forgotten men. Wipe your face, child,\" Ali\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The Cargo-apprentice smeared his hand across his chin and brought it away\r\n",
      "red and sticky. Luckily his teeth remained intact.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We need Hovan to read them more law,\" observed Kamil. \"You should have\r\n",
      "medical attention.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane dabbed at his mouth. He didn't need all that solicitude, but he\r\n",
      "guessed that Ali was talking for the benefit of those who now kept them\r\n",
      "under surveillance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Speaking of Hovan--I wonder what became of that pest he was supposed to\r\n",

      "the Tower, did he?\" asked Rip.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If it gets loose in that building,\" Dane decided to give the powers who\r\n",
      "held them in custody something to think about, \"they'll have trouble.\r\n",
      "Practically invisible and poisonous. And maybe it can reproduce its kind,\r\n",
      "too. We don't know anything about it--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ali laughed. \"Such fun and games! Imagine a hundred of the dear creatures\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Would that scrap of information send some Patrolmen hurtling off to the\r\n",
      "Tower in search of the caged creature? The thought of such an expedition\r\n",
      "was, in a small way, comforting to the captives.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An hour or so later they were fed, noiselessly and without visible\r\n",
      "attendants, when three trays slid through a slit in the wall at floor\r\n",
      "level. Rip's nose wrinkled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now I get the vector! We're plague-ridden--keep aloof and watch to see\r\n",
      "if we break out in purple spots!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ali was lifting thermo lids from the containers and now he suddenly arose\r\n",
      "and bowed in the direction of the blank wall. \"Many, many thanks,\" he\r\n",
      "intoned. \"Nothing but the best--a sub-commander's rations at least! We\r\n",
      "shall deliver top star rating to this thoughtfulness when we are\r\n",
      "questioned by the powers that shine.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It _was_ good food. Dane ate cautiously because of his torn lip, but the\r\n",
      "whole adventure took on a more rose-colored hue. The lapse of time before\r\n",
      "they were put through the usual procedure followed with criminals, this\r\n",
      "excellent dinner--it was all promising. The Patrol could not yet be sure\r\n",
      "how they were to be handled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They've fed us,\" Ali observed as he clanged the last dish back on a\r\n",

      "nights--of bunk time right about now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But that hint was not taken up and they continued to sit on the bench as\r\n",
      "time limped by. According to Dane's watch it must be night now, though\r\n",
      "the steady light in the windowless room did not vary. What had Hovan\r\n",
      "discovered in the Queen? Had he been able to rouse any of the crew? And\r\n",
      "was the spacer still inviolate, or had the Terrapolice and the Patrol\r\n",
      "managed to take her over?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was so very tired, his eyes felt as if hot sand had been poured\r\n",
      "beneath the lids, his body ached. And at last he nodded into naps from\r\n",
      "which he awoke with jerks of the neck. Rip was frankly asleep, his\r\n",
      "shoulders and head resting against the wall, while Ali lounged with\r\n",
      "closed eyes. Though the Cargo-apprentice was sure that Kamil was more\r\n",
      "alert than his comrades, as if he waited for something he thought was\r\n",
      "soon to occur.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dane dreamed. Once more he trod the reef rising out of Sargol's shallow\r\n",
      "sea. But he held no weapon and beneath the surface of the water a gorp\r\n",
      "lurked. When he reached the break in the water-washed rock just ahead,\r\n",
      "the spidery horror would strike and against its attack he was\r\n",
      "defenseless. Yet he must march on for he had no control over his own\r\n",
      "actions!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wake up!\" Ali's hand was on his shoulder, shaking him back and forth\r\n",

      "space-whirly moonbat?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The gorp--\" Dane came back to the present and flushed. He dreaded\r\n",

      "also think them out of some of the tangles which could not be solved by\r\n",
      "his own direct action methods. Direct action had been applied to their\r\n",

      "often the laws as enforced by the Patrol favored the wealth and might of\r\n",
      "the Companies, that law could be twisted and the Patrol sent to push\r\n",
      "through actions which, though legal, were inherently unfair to those who\r\n",

      "now he was certain that the Eysies were bringing all the influence they\r\n",

      "At the end of their ordeal their statements were read back to them from\r\n",
      "the recording tape and they thumb signed them. Were these statements or\r\n",
      "confessions, Dane mused. Perhaps in their honest reports they had just\r\n",
      "signed their way into the moon mines. Only there was no move to lead them\r\n",
      "out and book them. And when Weeks pressed his thumb at the bottom of the\r\n",

      "Steen Wilcox as they both sipped steaming mugs of real Terran coffee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "fairly sure by now that any penalty the Patrol or the Terrapolice would\r\n",

      "more serious affair--a matter which might ground them more effectively\r\n",
      "than any rule of the law enforcement bodies. And Jellico took to pacing\r\n",

      "that in some fantastic way he had managed to bring their venture down in\r\n",

      "into a position where he could control the situation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He halted just within the doorway and eyed Dane, Ali, and Rip with mock\r\n",
      "severity. \"You're baaaad boys,\" he told them with a shake of the head and\r\n",

      "list.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "held at assignment. However, he found the news heartening instead of\r\n",
      "discouraging. Compared to a bleak sentence at the moon mines such\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At the Cargo-master's nod, Jellico added. \"Ship pays that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So I told them,\" Van Rycke agreed. \"The Queen's warned off Terra for ten\r\n",
      "solar years--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They could take that, too. Other Free Traders got back to their home\r\n",
      "ports perhaps once in a quarter century. It was so much less than they\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No earth-side leave--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "planet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To Inter-Solar?\" Wilcox asked the important question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Van Rycke was smiling broadly, as if the loss he had just announced was\r\n",
      "in some way a gain. \"No--to Combine!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Combine?\" the Captain echoed and his puzzlement was duplicated around\r\n",
      "the circle. How did Inter-Solar's principal rival come into it?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We've made a deal with Combine,\" Van Rycke informed them. \"I wasn't\r\n",
      "going to let I-S cash in on our loss. So I went to Vickers at Combine and\r\n",
      "told him the situation. He understands that we were in solid with the\r\n",
      "Salariki and that the Eysies are not. And a chance to point a blaster at\r\n",
      "I-S's tail is just what he has been waiting for. The shipment will go out\r\n",
      "to the storm priests tomorrow on a light cruiser--it'll make it on time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes, a light cruiser, one of the fast ships maintained by the big\r\n",
      "Companies, could make the transition to Sargol with a slight margin to\r\n",
      "spare. Stotz nodded his approval at this practical solution.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm going with it--\" That did jerk them all up short. For Van Rycke to\r\n",
      "leave the Queen--_that_ was as unthinkable as if Captain Jellico had\r\n",
      "suddenly announced that he was about to retire and become a kelp farmer.\r\n",
      "\"Just for the one trip,\" the Cargo-master hastened to assure them. \"I\r\n",
      "smooth their vector with the storm priests and hand over so the Eysies\r\n",
      "will be frozen out--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Captain Jellico interrupted at that point. \"D'you mean that Combine is\r\n",
      "_buying_ us out--not just taking over? What kind of a deal--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Van Rycke, his smile a brilliant stretch across his plump face, was\r\n",
      "nodding in agreement. \"They're taking over our contract and our place\r\n",
      "with the Salariki.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In return for what?\" Steen Wilcox asked for them all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For twenty-five thousand credits and a mail run between Xecho and\r\n",
      "Trewsworld--frontier planets. They're far enough from Terra to get around\r\n",
      "the exile ruling. The Patrol will escort us out and see that we get down\r\n",
      "to work like good little space men. We'll have two years of a nice, quiet\r\n",
      "run on regular pay. Then, when all the powers that shine have forgotten\r\n",
      "about us, we can cut in on the trade routes again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And the pay?\" \"First or second class mail?\" \"When do we start?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Standard pay on the completion of each run--Board rates,\" he made\r\n",
      "replies in order. \"First, second and third class mail--anything that\r\n",
      "bears the government seal and out in those quarters it is apt to be\r\n",
      "_anything_! And you start as soon as you can get to Xecho and relieve the\r\n",
      "Combine scout which has been holding down the run.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"While you go to Sargol--\" commented Jellico.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"While I make one voyage to Sargol. You can spare me,\" he dropped one of\r\n",
      "his big hands on Dane's shoulder and gave the flesh beneath it a quick\r\n",
      "squeeze. \"Seeing as how our juniors helped pull us out of this last\r\n",
      "mix-up we can trust them about an inch farther than we did before.\r\n",
      "Anyway--Cargo-master on a mail run is more or less a thumb-twiddling job\r\n",
      "at the best. And you can trust Thorson on stowage--that's one thing he\r\n",
      "_does_ know.\" Which dubious ending left Dane wondering as to whether he\r\n",
      "had been complimented or warned. \"I'll be on board again before you know\r\n",
      "it--the Combine will ship me out to Trewsworld on your second trip across\r\n",
      "and I'll join ship there. For once we won't have to worry for awhile.\r\n",
      "Nothing can happen on a mail run.\" He shook his head at the three\r\n",
      "youngest members of the crew. \"You're in for a very dull time--and it\r\n",
      "will serve you right. Give you a chance to learn your jobs so that when\r\n",
      "you come up for reassignment you can pick up some of those files you were\r\n",
      "just demoted. Now,\" he started briskly for the door, \"I'll tranship to\r\n",
      "the Combine cruiser. I take it that you _don't_ want to meet the Video\r\n",
      "people?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At their hasty agreement to that, he laughed. \"Well, the Patrol doesn't\r\n",
      "want the Video spouting about 'high-handed official news suppression' so\r\n",
      "about an hour or so from now you'll be let out the back way. They put the\r\n",
      "Queen in a cradle and a field scooter will take you to her. You'll find\r\n",
      "her serviced for a take-off to Luna City. You can refit there for deep\r\n",
      "space. Frankly the sooner you get off-world the happier all ranks are\r\n",
      "going to be--both here and on the Board. It will be better for us to walk\r\n",
      "softly for a while and let them forget that the Solar Queen and her crazy\r\n",
      "crew exists. Separately and together you've managed to break--or at least\r\n",
      "bend--half the laws in the books and they'd like to have us out of their\r\n",
      "minds.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Captain Jellico stood up. \"They aren't any more anxious to see us go\r\n",

      "and we're lucky to get out of it this easy--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Van Rycke rolled his eyes ceilingward. \"You'll never know how lucky! Be\r\n",

    "I'm a bit stuck on this one. From the word count alone, I am going to make some assumptions about the text. First, I am guessing that this story takes place in Denmark given that \"dane\" is the most common word in the text. Similar to Frankenstein, the nonhuman takes up little space in the text. \"Ship\" appears semi-frequently, but it is the only reference to setting that appears in the word cloud (other than \"dane\"). I'm going to assume that while this story perhaps takes place on a ship related to Denmark, the setting itself is less important in the story than the interactions between characters. Words like \"go,\" \"make,\" \"man,\" and \"time\" appear frequently, which to me are words related to actions that humans take and ways of being in the world. This story is not a world-building story like Lord of the Rings. The details in the story are a bit unclear. While the story is called Plague Ship, there is no reference to disease, which perhaps points to the possibility that the \"disease\" aspect of the story is explained using words that do not relate to diseases. This is interesting; I wonder how much disease can play a role when it is not referenced that often! Maybe the author establishes disease at the beginning of the story and doesn't really have to talk about it again -- the \"disease\" aspect might just exist in the readers' imaginations and not necessarily in tangible words on the page.

Free Traders take on trading contracts on remote and recently discovered planets, which can be dangerous and unpredictable.\\n</p><p>The Solar Queen has recently obtained a valuable trading contract on the planet Sargol and are building a relationship with one of the races on the planet, the cat-like Salariki.  The process goes slowly till the Salariki discover that the Solar Queen is carrying catnip and other plants from Terra that are unknown on Sargol.  The traders exchange what little of the plants they have for the rare and valuable Koros stones and collect a native red-colored wood to exchange at home. At the last minute the storm priests of the Salariki demand that the Solar Queen take a pre-paid contract to return within 6 months with more plants.\\n</p><p>A few days after leaving the planet, several members of the crew suffer from attacks, which start with severe headaches and end in a semi-coma state.  Only 4 of the younger members of the crew are unaffected, including Dane Thorson.  Upon exiting hyperspace on return to the vicinity of Terra, the crew discovers that they are pariah and have been declared a plague ship.\\n</p><p>On the short hop to earth, the crew discovers that pests have invaded the ship and are the cause of the illness.  In a final bid to prove their case they kidnap a medic and present his evidence by video to a solar-system-wide audience, which is successful.\\n</p><p>In the meantime the rest of the crew have recovered, and after a final effort of negotiation the Solar Queen preserves its reputation by selling the contract with the Salariki to a large intergalactic trading company in exchange for credits and a quiet inter-solar mail route, which should lead to no more trouble.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sources\">Sources</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Plague_Ship&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Sources\"><span>edit</span></a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\\n<ul><li><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1215172403\"><cite id=\"CITEREFChalkerMark_Owings1998\" class=\"citation book cs1\"><a href=\"/wiki/Jack_L._Chalker\" title=\"Jack L.

    "Wow! This is not what I was expecting at all. I had no idea that this was the second book in a series, nor did I realize that the story took place on a spaceship! I thought that it took place on a ship in the ocean.I also find it funny that \"dane\" is not refering to Denmark but to the main character of the book. Now that I know what the story is about, some of the words in the word cloud make more sense. \"Come\" and \"go\" could be referencing the trade aspect of the story and the movement of the ship. \"Queen\" and \"salariki\" are obviously referencing the Solar Queen and the Salariki cat-people. It also makes sense that \"disease\"-related words are not common, as it seems like the story does not depend heavily upon the specifics of the disease. The disease or plague on the ship, which are caused by the pests, functions more as a mechanism to explore the social and political aspects of the relationship betwen the traders and the space government. This is interesting to me because it points to the way that the presence or absence of certain words drives the story. This is a story about politics, about intergalactic capitalism, and yet this is not very clear from the word-counts. It seems as if the combination of certain words and not necessarily the frequency of them matters more for producing stories. Maybe \"politics\" is not its own thing but is rather an imaginary produced by the combination of words like \"make,\" \"come,\" \"must,\" \"right,\" and \"know.\" "

    "I think that this experiment reveals what is probably already commonly known in the digital humanities: that word count is not enough to teach us about stories or discourses. This is why other digital techniques exist -- techniques like topic modeling, making use of n-grams, and networking. In the Frankenstein analysis, the word-counts did allow for a rather creative and exciting process of connecting the high-frequency words to my already-existing understanding of the story. In this case, counting words can play a role in literary analysis! However, for making sense of texts that are unknown to me, they were not very revealing. I was kind of in the dark the whole time, and I got major aspects of the story wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite word-counts not helping much for understanding texts that we have not read, I think they point us towards an interesting question of meaning-making. Making meaning is not necessarily a process of using the same words over and over again, but is rather about combining words. To understand a text is not to take in each word separately, but is to take in words together while reading over time. There is an element of time here as well as an element of relationality. This experiment supports a common idea in literary and social theory: that words do not necessarily reference things that exist outside of language, but rather only reference other words! It's words all the way down, stacked on top of each other. To use an example from Plague Ship, politics, capitalism, and trade are not necessarily solid \"things\" that exist outside of language, but are rather conglomerates of other words! This is the only way that a book so focused on trade and politics can convey those ideas without actually referencing the words \"trade\" and \"politics\" so frequently. Interesting!"
