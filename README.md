In this project, I explore how counting words can assist with the analysis of literature. I use python to count the words in two texts -- Frankenstein, which I know, and Plague Ship, which is new to me -- and I proceed to conduct a short analysis on both texts taking into account the frequency of words. I conclude that the number of words can assist with literary analysis but cannot be the sole method of conducting literary analysis. I end by offering some ways that frequencies of words illuminate the way that meaning and language works.
